Episode 5x08: The Ski Lift

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,700
Well, thanks... thanks for coming over.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,500
- Ah, you know, please.
- You've been...

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,400
you look fantastic. Look at you.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,200
- Really?!
- You never looked better in your life.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,200
- Oh, thank you.
- You're a lucky man, you're a blessed man.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,700
Well, you know, I took, uh...

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,600
I took care of myself. I was never an alcoholic or a drug addict, or...

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,400
never slept with a lot strange women, although I wanted to, they wouldn't...

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,000
you know...

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,804
I need a kidney, man.

12
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,802
Where am I gonna find someone who loves me enough just to give me a kidney?

13
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:41,900
Come on, you took the test. You're a match.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,000
Are you gonna give me the kidney or not?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,800
- I'm struggling.
- Well, what's wrong with Louis Lewis?

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,100
- I mean, he's... in this...
- Oh, please.

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,700
... coma in the hospital. How long can he go on?

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,200
- And he's family.
- He's in a coma.

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,100
Comas are unpredictable for Christ's sake.

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,000
Who the hell fucking knows?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,900
Family.

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,000
Fuck family.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,900
You know, and you know what's pissing me off?

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,500
I'm so low on that list, that kidney transplant list.

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,600
It's so unfair.

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,300
Look at the Mick. I mean, the Mick...

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,000
I love the guy, we were friends.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,700
Mantle got his liver just like that...

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,800
- Boom.
- Yeah. Well, if you were a little bigger celebrity,

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
you'd be on the top of the list too.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
Jesus Christ.

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,500
By the way, that... see that ball?

33
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,800
That's the 500th home run that the Mick hit.

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm leaving it... it's in my will.

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
It's yours.

36
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,900
- No kidding.
- Yeah. It's worth about 20 grand. I mean...

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,400
- What?!
- And you get the money too.

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,200
I'm giving you the bread and the ball.

39
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,300
Hey, remember in camp, when you used to do...

40
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,900
the Mick round... do the Mick rounding the bases.

41
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,900
Yeah.

42
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,600
- That's Mickey's run. Yep.
- Huh?

43
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,000
- You look great.
- Mickey Mantle.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, that's Mantle.

45
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,700
- Well, I'm gonna take off.
- When are you coming back?

46
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,100
- Yeah, I'll come back.
- Soon?

47
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,300
Yeah.

48
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,700
And let me ask you a question:

49
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,500
You like this sweater?

50
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,400
- How's it look?
- You know...

51
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
if you're doing an Andy Williams summer show.

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
See, you still got your sense of humor.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,800
- You still got it.
- I love you, Larry.

54
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
I really love you.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,400
And if my cousin stays in that coma,

56
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,900
I'm depending on you.

57
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

58
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,500
- I'm Lisa, his nurse.
- Oh, hi I'm Larry.

59
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,500
It was nice of him to give you his ball like that.

60
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,200
- The ball, yeah... that's was very nice.
- It was very good.

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,600
- Yeah.
- Hey, I wanted to...

62
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,900
tell you, you know? We have a mutual acquaintance.

63
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,000
I know Jeff.

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,700
- You know Jeff?
- I do. Yeah yeah.

65
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,900
We actually dated a little bit.

66
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,700
- Really?!
- Yeah, not too long. But uh...

67
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,300
Wow. So did you have a good time with him?

68
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,300
Well, until things got, you know, intimate, it was fun. You know, he's...

69
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,200
He's kind of a "slam, bam, thank you, ma'am" kind of guy, right?

70
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,600
- No, not really at all.
- No?

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,100
- Oh! 
- No. No slamming, no bamming.

72
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,400
No thanking the ma'am.

73
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,000
He's was a little... it was short lived, was the problem.

74
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,800
He was like that.

75
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I mean, it was dark, but honest to god it was...

76
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
like that.

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
What, are you kidding?

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,100
Uh, no, I'm not kidding.

79
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,100
- Jeff?!
- Yeah, very small, very small.

80
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,100
- It was like a peanut. That little...
- All right. This is a very...

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,300
you know, way too much information here, okay?

82
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,300
I actually thought you knew...

83
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,200
would've known that.
- How can I know such a thing?

84
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,900
I just would think that that's something that

85
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,600
friends men would talk about.

86
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,500
- No, nobody ever talks about that.
- Really?

87
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,700
- No.
- Sorry about that.

88
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,900
I don't even know what to say to you, but...

89
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,900
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah yeah.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Comas are very unpredictable.

91
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,800
Could wake up in five seconds,

92
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,000
five minutes,

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
five years!

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,800
You don't know. You just don't know.

95
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
They're unpredictable.

96
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,600
- Oh! Didn't even tell you!
- What?

97
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,800
Ran into somebody you went out with.

98
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,300
- Oh.
- She's Lewis's nurse.

99
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,000
- Lisa Thompson?
- Yeah. You had a little uh...

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,100
- A little thing. Yeah.
- A little thing with her, didn't you?

101
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,300
- Yeah yeah yeah.
- Hmm...

102
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,300
- Didn't work out.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
She told me you had...

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
W hat?

105
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,900
No no no.

106
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,200
- Big vagina?!
- Gigantic vagina!

107
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,200
- What?!
- Biggest vagina known to man!

108
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,200
- Huge!
- You're kidding.

109
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,200
- Are you telling me the truth?
- It's gigantic.

110
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Gigantic.

111
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,700
So why is she going around making this accusation?

112
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,500
Because maybe she's afraid that you'll find out she has a big vagina.

113
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,600
Why would would she even do that?

114
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,300
- I don't even know.
- Nipping it in the bud?

115
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,000
How dare she?

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,800
I'll tell you what.

117
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,300
I bet you there's a ton of guys out there

118
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,300
who've been labeled with "small penis."

119
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,200
- I bet you 50%...
- It's the vagina, isn't it?

120
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,600
- And it's the big vagina.
- Yeah. Think of it biologically...

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,200
why should there be as many big vaginas as there are small penises, right?

122
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,800
These big vagina ladies are getting away with murder.

123
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,000
Something should be done. I don't know what can be done,

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
but something should be done. Either...

125
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,100
We're a hell of lot more discrete than they are, right?

126
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,000
- Oh, man, they...
- They can't do this enough, can they?

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,800
- Oh, they love it,
- They love it.

128
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,300
They love this thing.

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, you know what? This is me from now on.

130
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Yeah.

131
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Hello, doctor.

132
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,700
Oh. Hi, doctor.

133
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,900
- How's he doing?
- You know how he's doing.

134
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm on to you, Mr. David.

135
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,900
- Excuse me.
- The frequent visits,

136
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,700
the questions about organs, come on.

137
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,700
I'm not crazy. I'm chief of staff here. I know what's going on.

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,600
What's going on?

139
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
I think you've been waiting for this man to die

140
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,200
so you can get one of his organs, preferably his kidney,

141
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,600
so you won't have to give up one,

142
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
so that Mr. Lewis can get it.

143
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,800
What kind of person would do something like that?

144
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,104
I think you know what kind of person would do that, Mr. David.

145
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:58,105
- A kind of person like me?!
- Yes.

146
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:04,300
That's pretty good... pretty good work.

147
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,400
Thank you, thank you.

148
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,100
He got me.

149
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Good job, doctor.

150
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
- I think you got me.
- I got ya.

151
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,800
By the way, my in-laws can't go skiing, so...

152
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,000
I've got an opening for you and Cheryl if you want it.

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
- Why would I go skiing?
- Come on.

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,500
No, it's a big schlep.

155
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,700
Isn't that George Lopez?

156
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,700
- He had a kidney transplant.
- Right. Right right...

157
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,000
Get some inside information?

158
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,600
- Hey, George.
- What's going on, Larry? How're you doing?

159
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,200
- Good. How are you?
- Good, brother.

160
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,500
This is Jeff Greene, my manager.

161
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,700
- Hey, Jeff. George Lopez.
- Pleasure.

162
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,600
- How's it going?
- Good. Feel great,

163
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
better than I have ever in my life.

164
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

165
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,200
I had a kidney transplant. My wife gave it to me.

166
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,400
Changed my whole life, man.

167
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,000
I mean, without it, I don't even know if I'd be alive, to tell you the truth.

168
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,300
You know, uh, Richard Lewis needs one.

169
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,900
I didn't know that. Ooh, man. Poor Richard.

170
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,100
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wow.

171
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,000
Well, he's got to go to his family or his friends. Somebody's gotta step up.

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
- Oh, yeah yeah.
- That's true.

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,800
Like a five-year waiting list.

174
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,500
So what do you think he should do? 'Cause he's like on the bottom of the list.

175
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,700
Well, if you're the bottom of the list, you're fucked.

176
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,000
But you know what?

177
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,300
Like, I've heard that the guy who's the head of the kidney consortium

178
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,600
...can be gotten to.
- Really?

179
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,500
Yeah, I mean, he really takes care of his friends. Buddy up to him.

180
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,000
Kiss his ass.

181
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Who knows?

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,900
Probably move Richard up the list.

183
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,400
- Really?
- Wow.

184
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,100
- All right, I got to get blood drawn.
- Thanks, George.

185
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,300
Nice meeting you. Take care, dude.

186
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,900
Oh, hey, George.

187
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,500
What's his name?

188
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,800
Ben Heineman.

189
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
- With an e or a y?
- With an E.

190
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Hey, Mr. Jones.

191
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,500
There's actually something else you could do for me too.

192
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,100
- Really?
- It's unrelated to the adoption.

193
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,100
I need some information about a Ben Heineman.

194
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
- "Ben Heineman".
- He's the head of the kidney consortium.

195
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,100
Okay.

196
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,100
Anything you can find out about his guy would be fantastic...

197
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,800
- H-e-i-n-e-m-a-n.
- Yeah, I got it.

198
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,200
Well, "Heineman" could be spelled a couple different ways.

199
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,000
- Oh, this is my wife.
- I'm Cheryl.

200
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,100
- This is Omar Jones, private investigator.
- Mrs. David.

201
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,100
- Oh, right.
- He's working on the whole adoption thing.

202
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,900
- Right.
- Yeah. I'm making some great headway also.

203
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,800
- Oh, fantastic.
- Okay, couple of weeks,

204
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,500
you should know something very definitive.

205
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
- Great.
- Great, okay.

206
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,400
- Enjoy your day.
- Thank you. You too.

207
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

208
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,100
I, uh... I got you something.

209
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,500
- Wow! New jacket?
- It's nice, right?

210
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,000
- Yeah.
- Yes, I needed this.

211
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,400
You're gonna need it when we go skiing

212
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,500
with Susie and Jeff.
- Skiing? Are you kidding?

213
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,300
Come on, that's out. I nixed that.

214
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,000
Look, you don't have to ski. You can sit inside and enjoy the snow.

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,800
I'm not going up to that lodge. Come on, man.

216
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,300
- Why?
- Too much schlepping. I'm not...

217
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
he left something. What is this?

218
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,900
Edible undies?

219
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
Oh, dear.

220
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay, big Yankee fan. He's an orthodox jew.

221
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,900
All right, what else you got?

222
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,700
Drives a gold cadillac.

223
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,200
License plate number 2-F-A-N-3-2-1.

224
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Okay, thank you.

225
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,900
- So, Omar Jones the private investigator?
- Yeah?

226
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,000
He got me some information about the head of the kidney consortium.

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,400
- Guess what?
- What?

228
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,600
- He's an orthodox jew.
- You're kidding.

229
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
No. So...

230
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
what needs to be done here is that...

231
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
I need to somehow befriend this guy.

232
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,100
I need to get close to him quickly.

233
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,600
- Right? 
- Yeah. How're you gonna do that?

234
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,000
- If I could save his life or something.
- Uh-huh.

235
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You know, like... bad example, okay? Not this.

236
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,000
- You know, you pushed him off a building...
- I push him off the building.

237
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,900
- And I saved him.
- And you would catch him.

238
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,100
- And I catch him.
- Yeah?

239
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,700
- He would be indebted to me for...
- Yeah.

240
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,600
He would do anything I asked him, like put my friend on the top of the kidney list.

241
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,400
And at no point, he says to you, "Hey, what about the fat guy

242
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,100
that just threw me off the roof?"
- No.

243
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,100
- That would never come up.
- I said it's bad version.

244
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,800
Really bad version.

245
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,500
But I need to save his life. It's gotta be something like that.

246
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

247
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Well...

248
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,300
- This isn't bad.
- What?

249
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,700
- That's it.
- The cadillac?

250
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,200
Gold... the gold cadillac. See it?

251
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,600
Go check the license.

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,500
Yeah, that's it.

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,200
- Ready?
- Yeah, as ready as I'm gonna be.

254
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Whenever you want, go ahead.

255
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
- This is crazy. Let's go.
- All right.

256
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
All right.

257
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,400
It's like you didn't even hit it.

258
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,400
- All right let's try it again.
- You try it again. I don't want whiplash.

259
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
No.

260
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,300
You do it.

261
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
- Keep a lookout.
- I'm keeping a lookout.

262
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
- Anybody coming?
- No, we're fine.

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh my god.

264
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Here, come on. Be careful.

265
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,600
Oh my god.

266
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Are you all right?

267
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think I'm okay.

268
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,500
Holy shit, it's all over your glasses, your whole face.

269
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Oh my god.

270
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,000
- Oh, there. You did it.
- It worked.

271
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes.

272
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,100
All right, good. Let's get out of here. Come on.

273
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,900
- Mr...
- Mr. David?

274
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,400
- Mr. Heineman.
- How are you, sir?

275
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,200
What a great great pleasure to meet you.

276
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,500
Well, it's nice to meet you.

277
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

278
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,100
- So?
- I'm sorry I'm a little late,

279
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,000
uh, you know...

280
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
It's not a big problem.

281
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,300
What a mitzvah it was for you to leave that note on my car.

282
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,900
Well, how could I do anything less that that?

283
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,600
I'd have to be a sociopath to hit somebody's car and then,

284
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,600
and then go away into the night as if nothing happened.

285
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,700
- Thank you, thank you.
- What happened, I was listening to jewish radio

286
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,700
and they were talking about Israel and I got so worked up

287
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,600
I lost control of my car.

288
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,300
- May I offer you some lunch?
- Please.

289
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,800
Morty, menus, please.

290
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
It's kosher, you know that.

291
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,900
Oh. Let's see, wait a second.

292
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Hello?

293
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,700
No no no no no. Uh, thank you...

294
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,300
thank you for that invitation, but I cannot go

295
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,400
to the baseball game on the Sabbath, I'm sorry.

296
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
It's impossible.

297
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,600
I'll take a rain check, however.

298
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,400
Ho ho ho ho, okay.

299
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
I'd love to go to the game, but not on the Sabbath.

300
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,300
The Yankees are playing and I would...

301
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
- I would kill to go down there.
- You're a Yankee fan.

302
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Oh, I'm a Yankee fan... I'm a huge Yankee fan.

303
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,300
- I love the Yankees.
- You love the Yankees?!

304
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,400
There's so many times when the Yankees were playing in Anaheim

305
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,600
that I've so much wanted to go to see it.

306
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,100
I even cheat by watching it on television. I shouldn't do that.

307
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,600
There are two things in my life that I love. Besides family and my work.

308
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,200
- I love baseball. Love baseball
- Uh-huh.

309
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,700
...especially Yankees. I love to ski.

310
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,900
My yarmulke almost fell off, I'm so taken aback.

311
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,800
- What?
- Skiing. You said skiing?

312
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,300
- Yeah. Well, I'm not that good, but I like...
- I'm not so good myself,

313
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,400
but I love it.
- You love it?

314
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,900
Oh... my favorite thing to do in life.

315
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,300
Isn't that a wonderful coincidence?

316
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,800
- I have a little ski lodge.
- Really?

317
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,500
Yes. I would love to invite you

318
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,900
to go skiing.
- My goodness, what a wonderful gesture.

319
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

320
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
- So...
- Welcome back.

321
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,100
You know, I spoke to our mutual friend.

322
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,200
- Oh, good. Did you say hello for me?
- I did.

323
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
- Oh, great, thank you.
- I did say hello, and...

324
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I couldn't help but mention the...

325
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
the whole kind of small penis thing.

326
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,200
It came out.

327
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,100
- Oh my gosh, was he upset?
- Not at all, not at all.

328
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,800
- No.
- Really?

329
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,800
In fact, he had a completely different take on it than you.

330
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,500
He said the problem didn't lie with his small penis,

331
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,800
but rather...

332
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
with your big vagina.

333
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
- Is that what he did?!
- Yeah.

334
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,200
- Big.
- This is my vagina?

335
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Huge.

336
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,900
- Huge.
- Are you kidding?

337
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,500
I don't have a big vagina.

338
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
- You got the huge vagina.
- Oh, do I?

339
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,100
- You're blaming the small penis,
- Yeah well...

340
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,300
you got the huge vagina.

341
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,500
It's not necessary.

342
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,300
You know I made a little... you're the one that egged it...

343
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Methinks the lady doth protest too much.

344
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,300
This guy is the head of the whole kidney consortium.

345
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,300
I can get you to the top of the list. I'm not kidding.

346
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,300
I got him eating out of my hand. He's going skiing with me.

347
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,800
Holy shit. That would be unbelievable!

348
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,100
You know what would really cinch it?

349
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,800
He's a Yankee fan... big Mickey Mantle fan.

350
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,600
Let me give him the Mickey Mantle ball.

351
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,000
You're out of your fucking mind?

352
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,500
You don't want it?

353
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,000
- I'm nuts?
- You don't want it anymore?

354
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,900
Give that guy the Mickey Mantle ball, it's done, it's over.

355
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
All right, give it to him. Give it to him.

356
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,600
- Hey.
- What?

357
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,700
- Where's the ball?
- I don't know.

358
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,600
What? Look, maybe it rolled off.

359
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,400
Look behind the picture.

360
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,800
- Is it there?
- No.

361
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,700
- You're kidding me!
- No.

362
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,700
Jesus Christ.

363
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,100
Oh, Mickey.

364
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,700
Goddamn it!

365
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,500
- Oh, shit.
- Who's been here?

366
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,200
Who's been here? Lisa, the nurse, a couple of close friends and you.

367
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,800
It's no way my friends are gonna take anything, and her...

368
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,500
I see her leave with the same uniform.

369
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,800
She has no pockets.

370
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,000
I mean, if she... if she hid a ball in there, it would look like an elephant tumor.

371
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,200
Unless...

372
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Oh, hey.

373
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
There was a Mickey Mantle ball, his 500th home run

374
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
right over there,

375
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,500
and it's missing.

376
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,100
- Have you seen it?
- No, I have not.

377
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,900
Hmm, it's kind of curious, given that...

378
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,700
nobody else has been in the house, save for a few friends.

379
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,600
Could a ball worth an excess of $20,000

380
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,600
just disappear into thin air?

381
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,300
Wanna tell me what you're driving at?

382
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,500
I'll tell you what I'm driving at.

383
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,100
I submit you took that baseball,

384
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,900
stashed it in your unusually large vagina,

385
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,900
and walked right on out of here!

386
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,600
- Let me tell you something.
- Yeah?

387
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,700
- This bread...
- Good bread, right?

388
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,500
My second piece... I'm surprised you're even letting me.

389
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,700
- The bread and the croutons.
- Hey, by the way, have you seen my cell phone?

390
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,700
- You can't find it?
- No.

391
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,800
- No, it's gone.
- We'll go look again when we get home.

392
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Oh, remember?

393
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
- You invited me to the ski lodge?
- Yeah.

394
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,000
- I've changed my mind.
- Gonna go?

395
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,500
- Really?
- We... I'd like to go.

396
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
- Great. Oh that'll be great.
- You didn't tell me that.

397
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,300
We're gonna have a great time skiing, snowboarding maybe.

398
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,900
- I would love to try snowboarding.
- Yeah, I'm gonna try it.

399
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,500
- I'm gonna take a lesson.
- Yes, we'll take a lesson.

400
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,200
- That's good.
- That's fun. You'll like that.

401
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,000
- Oh my gosh.
- I'm not gonna snowboard.

402
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
- That's okay.
- Oh, and I hope you don't mind, but...

403
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I've also taken the liberty,

404
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,500
with your permission, of inviting an orthodox jew and his daughter.

405
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,000
Wait, what do you mean, what...

406
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
just an orthodox jew and his daughter? Where?

407
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
To stay in the chalet with us?
- Okay.

408
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,700
- The guy?
- The guy, yeah.

409
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,400
- What guy?
- Okay...

410
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,900
He's the head of the kidney consortium

411
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,100
and I'm trying to get Richard Lewis moved up on the list.

412
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,100
Let's be realistic. You're trying to get Lewis moved up on the list

413
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,200
or you're trying to save your own kidney?
- Either way, what's the difference?

414
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,500
- Let's just be clear here on what it's about.
- Okay, so... fine.

415
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,300
- I don't wanna give him my own kidney.
- I don't know if I want to spend a weekend

416
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,800
with these people.
- Why would you take them...

417
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,300
Forget the whole thing. I don't want my kidney.

418
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,300
- I don't care.
- You know what? You...

419
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,300
He can have my kidney! I'll walk around with a dialysis machine.

420
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
That will be fine! That's fine.
Don't worry about it.

421
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,000
If you gotta do it, you gotta do it. It is okay. Fine.

422
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,400
- Thank you. Thank you.
- We don't have a choice. You invited them.

423
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,200
We don't have a choice, but you know what?

424
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,800
It's a mitzvah.

425
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,600
You spend time with them. I'm not spending time...

426
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,700
- I'm not going to hang out or chit-chat...
- Unfortunately,

427
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,900
that's not the worst of the situation.

428
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
What?

429
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,300
- She's a wonderful cook, isn't she? My Susie?
- My pleasure.

430
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,100
Isn't she? Isn't she some cook?

431
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,900
How did you two meet?

432
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,700
- Interesting, interesting.
- Uh, we met at a hillel...

433
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,600
mixer, a function.
- Oh, in college?

434
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,200
Yes, a singles and he was there trying to pick up every girl imaginable.

435
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,900
- I was pretty swinging in those days.
- Yes.

436
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,300
I was in the band, okay?

437
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,200
The girls were pretty interested, you know?

438
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,000
With the guitar, they liked that.

439
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,400
- Not true, not true.
- Like a rock band?

440
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,900
- Jewish folk music, jewish folk songs.
- Folk, folk.

441
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,900
Like what songs?

442
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,100
Um, "gefilte fish blues"...

443
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,300
um, "my freaking back is killing me and it's making it hard to kvell"...

444
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,400
- Uh, what was the name of your band?
- "The hipsters"

445
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,000
Yes, it was "the hipsters"

446
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,400
- "Larry David and the hipsters."
- Yeah.

447
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,700
And then, I left the hipsters,

448
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,800
and I just became Larry David.
- Larry David.

449
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,300
And the hipsters went out on their own.

450
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,900
- And they became quite successful.
- Yes.

451
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,200
But I was not attracted to him from the band.

452
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
- Honestly, I felt sorry for him.
- Why?

453
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,000
That's was the...

454
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,300
It was an attraction out of pity

455
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,000
'cause I'm always the one to take in stray animals,

456
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,600
you know, that's...
- You remind me a little of my wife...

457
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,200
- Oh, how lovely.
- I would like to meet her at some point.

458
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Well, she's passed away a number of years ago.

459
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,300
- Six years.
- Six years? Difficult.

460
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So, anyway, enough about us.

461
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
- What do you do?
- I'm the head of a...

462
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
a foundation that finds kidneys for...

463
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,600
needy recipients.

464
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,600
- Global.
- A very, very dear friend of mine actually...

465
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,100
...needs a kidneys and he's...

466
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,600
- Sorry.
- He's on the bottom of the list, Richard Lewis,

467
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
perhaps you heard?
- Yes, I have.

468
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,100
- Wonderful comedian.
- Wears black all the time.

469
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,500
I would give him my own kidney, if only we were a match, but unfortunately...

470
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,500
that's alas, that is not the case.
- That's god's will.

471
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Excuse me?

472
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,300
What the fuck? What are you doing?!

473
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

474
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,200
- What are you doing in bed with me?
- My back hurts.

475
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,300
I don't give a shit. Do you think I care about your back?

476
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,400
- Come on.
- You know how much I've done for you

477
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,900
already this weekend? Get the fuck out of bed.

478
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,600
- It's cold.
- Get the fuck out of bed!

479
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,000
- What's that smell?
- What? Eggs.

480
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,500
What?! Bacon?!

481
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,200
What, are you crazy? You're making bacon?!

482
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,300
- Why?
- Why?

483
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,600
- What?
- Huh?

484
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,400
People don't eat bacon.

485
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,900
What, are you nuts?

486
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,300
It's not kosher. People... kosher,

487
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
- you know what that is.
- Well, they don't have to eat it.

488
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,900
How did you do last night?

489
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,800
I did fine. How did you do?

490
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,100
I missed you, honey.

491
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,600
I missed you too.

492
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

493
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,700
Good morning.

494
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,300
Uh, were these not the plates we ate the pot roast on last night?

495
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,800
They are the same plates, but they've been washed.

496
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,900
- What?!
- I shouldn't be having...

497
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,500
dairy on these kind of plates, you know. As you know,

498
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,300
the dairy and the meat are on two separate plates.

499
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,400
That's a necessary rule of being kosher.

500
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Where are the milchig plates?

501
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,900
- Where are they?
- The milchig plates!

502
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,900
- Where are they?
- The milchig plates...

503
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,100
well, they should be in the cabinet.

504
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,300
You were told about the milchig plates,

505
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
were you not?

506
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,600
- Okay. Well, I'm sorry about the uh...
- That's fine, I have to bury the plate

507
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,100
and we'll be done with it...
- You're gonna do what?

508
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,200
You have to bury the plate.

509
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Why would you bury a plate?

510
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
Why would you bury a plate?

511
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,200
Tell her.

512
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,700
You have to bury the plate to purify it. It has to go underground.

513
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,300
- Purify, you have to purify.
- I'm sure you probably have a whole set of china

514
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,700
in your backyard.
- You can't just wash it and call it a day?

515
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,600
- Uh, no we can't. I guess we'll starve tonight.
- No, no, you can't wash it and call it a day, no.

516
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,300
That's not how it works.

517
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,200
Do you wanna bury it as the man of the house

518
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,300
...as a respect?
- Nah, you bury, you bury.

519
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,900
You bury, it's a little early for burying.

520
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,900
I don't like to bury before coffee.

521
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,000
- Do I smell bacon?
- Bacon?

522
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
- Well...
- No. Oh, I was a little gassy. I lit a match.

523
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,000
You are a guest in this house.

524
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,700
Larry, come on.

525
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Larry.

526
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,400
Get off my skis.

527
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,700
- How about coming for one more run?
- Oh, sweetheart, I'm finished.

528
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,700
- Come on, we have time for one more.
- Whoa-ho. Hey hey hey.

529
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,500
- New world record.
- Whoa.

530
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,500
- Hello, Ben.
- Hello..

531
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,600
- Hello, Rachel.
- Hi, Larry.

532
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,300
- Boy, that was hard.
- Huh?

533
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,600
- How much fun is this?
- I'm having a good time.

534
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,100
- Isn't this fun?
- But I'm going home now

535
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,600
because I'm bushed.

536
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,700
- I'm gonna go for another run.
- Go go, sweetheart, go.

537
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,700
Why don't you go with her? You got time for one more run.

538
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,600
- One more?
- Go ahead.

539
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,200
- All right, one more run. Okay.
- I'm just gonna go back.

540
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,800
- No, there's time.
- No no, we're losing time.

541
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,900
No no, it's fine. I'm tired.

542
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,500
- One more run.
- One more. We'll do one more.

543
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,000
Rachel, uh...

544
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,900
He'll keep you company.

545
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,900
Larry, incidentally, the thing we were discussing earlier.

546
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,800
I'm thinking about it, and I...

547
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,300
I think I can actually help your friend.

548
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,600
I think I can move him up on the list.

549
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,300
I'm fainting. I'm gonna faint.

550
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,700
- Well, don't do that.
- I'm going to faint.

551
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
it's a pleasure to do it for you.

552
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,800
I know where you're going... when he dies...

553
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,200
right, right upstairs he's going. Right upstairs.

554
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,400
- God bless you.
- You're taking an escalator up there.

555
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,500
God bless you.

556
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,200
Now you two kids go. Go ski.

557
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,500
Rachel, come.

558
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Come.

559
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
What do people have against whistlers?

560
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,200
- Can you answer me this question?
- I think it's annoying.

561
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,500
I think it's 'cause they don't like to see people happy.

562
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,700
And who can blame them?

563
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,000
It's like a happy couple.

564
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,400
Is there anything more disgusting than that?

565
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,300
You know what I find very interesting?

566
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,900
I can't draw to save my life,

567
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,900
but yet, I'm a very good doodler.

568
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,600
Don't you think that's ironic?

569
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,300
It's somewhat ironic.

570
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,200
Hey, when we get back to the lodge,

571
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,600
how about you and I having a doodling contest, huh?

572
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,600
- What do you say?
- I'm feeling nauseous right now.

573
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,600
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

574
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,600
- What's going on?
- Don't worry. It happens all the time.

575
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Should only be a few minutes.

576
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,800
It's been 15 minutes already.

577
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,900
What's going on?

578
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,000
Shkiyas hachama. That's what's going on here.

579
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,400
- What?
- Shkiyas hachama.

580
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Sundown.

581
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,800
I can't be here alone with you after sundown.

582
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,200
- Why not?
- Because you're a man and I'm a single woman.

583
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,100
- So?
- So it's not allowed.

584
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,600
- Who says so?
- The law, the Torah says so.

585
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,000
- Hashem says so.
- Hashem?

586
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,300
- Do you know anything?
- No, Hashem, I know.

587
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,300
Anyway, it's okay. There's extenuating circumstances here.

588
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,300
No such thing as extenuating circumstances.

589
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Well, you got another half hour.

590
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,500
5:41. Shkiyas hachama is at 5:41.

591
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,700
- All right well, that's a half hour.
- Fine.

592
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,000
They'll fix it.

593
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Freezing!

594
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,900
I'm hungry too.

595
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
- You hungry?
- Yes, I'm very hungry.

596
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
What the heck is this?

597
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Hey!

598
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,300
Edible underwear!

599
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,800
I must...

600
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
the private investigator... when I went...

601
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,300
Unreal!

602
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,100
They're not bad.

603
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,200
- How much time do we have left...
- Want some?

604
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,300
- No, thank you.
- Take a bite.

605
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,400
- I'm fine please.
- Take a bite.

606
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,900
Move that away from me.

607
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,800
Just tell me how much time we have left.

608
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,500
- Well, I think you got about two minutes.
- Oh.

609
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,900
Somebody's gonna have to jump.

610
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,200
- Oh, stop.
- Stop what?

611
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,100
I can't be here with you after sundown!

612
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,000
There's no other way. Somebody's gonna have to jump!

613
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,500
You're gonna have to jump!

614
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,200
Are you gonna jump?

615
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,100
What, are you fucking nuts?

616
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
What?

617
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,800
What are you doing?

618
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,400
- No, no!
- Hold my phone.

619
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Are you crazy? Are you insane?

620
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,100
- Yeah?
- Hey, Richard. It's me.

621
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,400
Yeah, hi, Larry.

622
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,500
Listen, what I told you earlier about the kidney?

623
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,800
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's not gonna happen.

624
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,600
You're shitting me. Why not?!

625
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Uh, I can't go into it right now, but trust me, it's just... it's not gonna work out.

626
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,400
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, listen,

627
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,000
did I leave my cell phone in your house?

628
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,400
I don't know. Did you leave...

629
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,900
Did Larry David leave his cell phone in the house?

630
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,900
- No.
- No.

631
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,400
I'm gonna call my cell phone.

632
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,500
If you hear it ringing, pick it up, okay?

633
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Fine, fine.
