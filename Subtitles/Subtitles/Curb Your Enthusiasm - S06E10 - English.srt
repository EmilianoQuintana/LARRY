00:00:13,922 --> 00:00:16,482
Somebody need to talk to the man,
you know what I mean?

3
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:19,755
I'm so happy you called me.
He's just moping around?

4
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:21,489
I mean, we all are really worried
about him, man.

5
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:23,827
This Cheryl thing's
got him crazy.

6
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:25,924
This Cheryl thing's got him twisted, man,
for real.

7
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:28,834
He's up there moping, man.
Mopy Dick, that's what he is.

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,861
- Moby Dick.
- No, Mopy Dick.

9
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:33,601
- No, it's called Moby Dick.
- Who's fucking Moby Dick?

10
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:35,734
"Moby Dick" is the book
by Melville.

11
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:37,540
- Who's fucking Moby Dick?
- Where did you hear Moby Dick from?

12
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,910
Mopy Dick, man.
His dick is moping.

13
00:00:38,947 --> 00:00:41,177
- Oh, literally Mopy Dick?
- Yeah, Mopy Dick.

14
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,185
Okay, let's go up and get his
mopy-ass dick out of bed.

15
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,187
- Let's go.
- I like the way you operate, man.

16
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:49,247
You know what I mean?
You're straightforward. I like that shit.

17
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:52,387
What?

18
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,622
- Gotta come in?
- Coming in, man.

19
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:58,824
- Hey, what's going on?
- I don't know.

20
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:01,461
- I fucked up my life.
- How did you fuck up your life?

21
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:04,233
- What did you do?
- With Cheryl.

22
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,240
- Oh, Cheryl.
- Oh, man, this Cheryl shit again.

23
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,468
Come on, man.

24
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:10,672
The stupid call from the plane--
I didn't--

25
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:12,270
You were busy
with the TiVo guy.

26
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:15,476
Busy with the TiVo guy.
Yeah, I was busy with the TiVo guy.

27
00:01:15,517 --> 00:01:17,508
Your brain is all fucking
discombobulated, man.

28
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:19,042
You need to focus
on some ass.

29
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:22,716
I'm just never gonna meet
anybody like her again, ever ever.

30
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:25,555
I'm not disputing that,
but you've got to meet somebody else.

31
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:28,289
- You've got to move on.
- There's nobody that compares to her.

32
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:30,194
I can't even imagine
being with anybody else.

33
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:32,495
Listen, man, you've got
to get out there and do stuff.

34
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:34,798
Get down there and get breakfast.
What are you doing?

35
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:37,304
Is she going
to Sammie's bat mitzvah?

36
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:38,805
Yeah, she's coming
to the bat mitzvah.

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,808
She's bringing
that guy too.

38
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:45,771
What do you want me to do?
We didn't pick sides.

39
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,180
I can't believe I've got to see her
with this guy

40
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:50,309
- at Sammie's bat mitzvah.
- Well, who are you gonna bring?

41
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:52,148
- Nobody.
- You've got to bring somebody.

42
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:54,587
Bring somebody?
Who am I gonna bring?

43
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:57,056
You're not gonna find her here,
lying like this. Come on.

44
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:58,786
Yeah, you gotta
find somebody, man.

45
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,057
- I'm not a good dater. I can't date.
- Why can't you date?

46
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:03,655
You're not comfortable
in your Larry shell right now.

47
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:05,928
You've got to become
another motherfucker right now.

48
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:08,094
Larry, grow a mustache, man.
Grow a goatee,

49
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:10,764
a mustache, grow sideburns.
Become another motherfucker, man.

50
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:13,171
- You feel me?
- It's not bad advice.

51
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,268
It's not bad advice.
But anything to get your ass out of bed.

52
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:18,279
Get your ass out of--
wh--?

53
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:19,803
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

54
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,713
You've got bedbugs?
What's going on?

55
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:23,876
Oh, nothing. Just a little
uncomfortable.

56
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:27,183
- Listen, I did my part. Get your ass up.
- Okay, thanks.

57
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:29,122
- I've got to go to work, all right?
- Thanks, yeah.

58
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:31,318
- I'll see you later.
- Good work, man.

59
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,522
Hey, I'll get him up.
Hey, man, let's roll, L.D.

60
00:02:34,562 --> 00:02:37,929
Come on downstairs, man. The family
wants to talk to you a little bit.

61
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:40,730
- All right, I'm turning over a new leaf.
- Yeah, come on downstairs.

62
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,895
- That's it. No more of this shit.
- We want to talk to you.

63
00:02:42,937 --> 00:02:45,201
- Okay, no more.
- Yeah, get out. Let's get your shit
together.

64
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,174
- I'm getting it together.
- Yeah, think about that beard shit.

65
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,675
- Okay, all right.
- Think about that mustache.

66
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,947
Look who I found.

67
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,812
- Hey.
- Hey, L.D.!

68
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,544
- How are you doing?
- Yeah.

69
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:58,984
- Eh, I think okay. I think I'll be all right.
- Good.

70
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,419
- I'm fine.
- Good.

71
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:02,082
You know what?
My mind is made up.

72
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:04,853
- I am forgetting about her as of now.
- Okay.

73
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,225
- That's what I'm talking about.
- As of now.

74
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:09,890
- L.D., you're gonna be fine, trust me.
- It's a new day.

75
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:11,899
He'll be
the last man standing.

76
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,458
So what's going on?
What do you want to talk to me about?

77
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:15,833
Loretta,
you want to...?

78
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,168
Um, our house
is ready

79
00:03:18,206 --> 00:03:21,039
and we're gonna
go home.

80
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,907
Yeah yeah.
The lady called today.

81
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:26,846
- We're out for real.
- We are.

82
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,872
- We're not kidding you. We're out.
- No, for real.

83
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,612
- He's speechless. I can't believe it.
- Well...

84
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,916
I am speechless.

85
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:34,819
- You too?
- I'm out of here too.

86
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:37,416
I've got a little boo down there
I'ma holla at.

87
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,325
I know it looked like we weren't gonna ever
get out of here, though,

88
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:42,556
- but...
- Well...

89
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,531
- you gotta go-- you gotta go.
- Yeah.

90
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:45,998
- We're gonna miss you, though.
- We are.

91
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:47,729
You can always
come visit now.

92
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,203
Eh, let's not go crazy.

93
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:52,331
- My gerbil's gone.
- What?

94
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:55,399
- My gerbil's gone.
- What do you mean your gerbil's gone?

95
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,604
Well, come on.
Let's go find it.

96
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:59,545
- Chill out. We're cool.
- Chill out?

97
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,708
There's a gerbil running amok in my
house.
Come on, help me find it.

98
00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:07,621
Okay, thank you.

99
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:09,384
- Hey, Larry.
- Yeah.

100
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:12,052
- The building manager just called.
- Yeah?

101
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:14,857
In the next few days
somebody's gonna come

102
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:16,864
and look at that office
across from you.

103
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:19,162
- Are you kidding?
- No.

104
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,226
Oh, I dreaded this day.
I don't want anybody

105
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,862
moving in
across the hall.

106
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:26,100
You know, we have
privacy here.

107
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,937
I know. Larry,
there's nothing I can do.

108
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,103
We're not gonna have
control of the thermostat.

109
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,112
- That's right, it's in there.
- Yeah, it's in there.

110
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,579
Why don't we
take that office then?

111
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:36,048
I'm not gonna pay for an office
I'm not using.

112
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:38,552
Well, somebody's gonna take it
if you don't take it.

113
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:40,986
How do you stop somebody
from renting it?

114
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:43,081
That's what
I want to know.

115
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:45,957
How are you?

116
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,485
- You know, I feel a little better today.
- Do you?

117
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,292
- I've been pretty depressed.
- You seem better. You look good.

118
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,561
Yeah, I feel better.
I'm feeling like I'm ready,

119
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,830
but I hate being single.
I just hate it.

120
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:57,201
- I know, Larry. I'm sorry.
- I want to meet somebody.

121
00:04:57,238 --> 00:05:00,537
I swear to God, I can get married again
in a month if I could.

122
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:04,067
Oh, Larry. Larry David,
you are a romantic.

123
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:06,012
Am I?
Do you think I am?

124
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:08,242
Oh, I forgot.
Matt Tessler called and said,

125
00:05:08,282 --> 00:05:10,216
"Hey, I'm in the building.
I thought I'd drop by."

126
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:12,617
- He's in the building?
- Yeah.

127
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:14,587
He said he knows you,
"Seinfeld" days.

128
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:16,886
Yeah, he directed
four "Seinfelds."

129
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:18,789
He was terrible, though.
He was a terrible director.

130
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:20,623
- Oh, I remember Matt.
- What does he want?

131
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:23,926
Lewis is doing a pilot now,
and I'll bet he wants me to recommend
him.

132
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:26,957
- You know, he's got the son...
- Oh my gosh, that's right.

133
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,866
...who's got
the muscular issues.

134
00:05:28,903 --> 00:05:30,165
M.S. or M.D. or...?

135
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,468
I don't know.
There's something.

136
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:34,099
I could say
that you had to leave,

137
00:05:34,142 --> 00:05:36,110
- you had an important meeting.
- Eh...

138
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:39,602
- Larry David. Larry David, how ya doing?
- Hey, Matt Tessler!

139
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:42,275
- We were just talking about you.
- Good to see you.

140
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:45,149
Hey, Matt, what's going on?
Nice to see you. How are you?

141
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:47,177
- You're well? You look good.
- Yeah.

142
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,519
- You look pretty good yourself.
- Oh, thanks, thanks.

143
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,787
- Yeah, I'm doing okay, doing okay.
- Look at this.

144
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:53,589
- Working my ass off, yeah.
- Nice.

145
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:55,596
I'm just, you know--
I'm kind of stuck

146
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,155
- in a dramedy ghetto.
- Really?

147
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,861
Well, I did the cancer scare episode
of "Home lmprovement,"

148
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,668
- so I got typed as this guy who does
ticker.
- Oh, Jeez.

149
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,673
Now they want me to do
all the teardrop stuff.

150
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:09,039
I want to get back to the funny,
to the shtoomy.

151
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,012
- The shtoomy, yeah.
- Are you and Richard Lewis still tight?

152
00:06:12,046 --> 00:06:15,675
- Is there any way you can just give him
a--?
- I'm really not...

153
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:17,877
- You're not tight anymore?
- Not really tight.

154
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,149
'Cause they're floating my name
to direct his pilot

155
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:21,746
and I just would love
to be in on that.

156
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:23,984
Well, if I run into him,
I'll, you know--

157
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:26,755
Yeah, if I had a recommendation
from you, though,

158
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:28,762
that would mean
that I'd have a shot at this.

159
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:31,788
The sitcom-- you know,
I'd come in at 9:00-10:00,

160
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,358
- I'd get a chance to see my son
in the morning... - It's a great--

161
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:37,030
...l'd get a chance to see him at night.
So anything you could do

162
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:40,438
to recommend me to Richard
would be just great.

163
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:43,638
Yeah, I'll--
I'll recommend you.

164
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:45,578
- Bless your heart. Bless your heart.
- Yeah.

165
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,810
Hey, Larry, do you still have
that tickle in your anus?

166
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,011
I cannot get you an appointment
for two weeks.

167
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:53,384
What?

168
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:57,184
Are you experiencing
discomfort?

169
00:06:57,225 --> 00:07:00,786
Tickle in my-- what is she talking about?
What are you talking about?

170
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:02,887
- Where did you get that from?
- That's nothing to joke around about.

171
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,090
Who were you trying
to get an appointment with?

172
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,963
- Rosenberg.
- Rosenberg is a good man.

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,093
I've got a better one.
Pencil.

174
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,604
Call this man--
Dr. Jay Whitney.

175
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,005
My wife's cousin Kai--
she runs the office.

176
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,475
- Oh, she does?
- She can open all the doors,

177
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:18,445
and not just the back one,
you know what I mean?

178
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,208
Seriously, she can
get you in today.

179
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:21,840
- Yeah.
- You don't have to think about it.

180
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:24,283
It's nice of you, but there's really
nothing wrong.

181
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,252
Why did you say
I have a tickle in my anus?

182
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:29,381
Are you fucking crazy, huh?
A tickle in my anus?

183
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:31,220
- She's just looking out for you.
- Why did you say that?

184
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,624
I don't have a tickle.
Who said that?

185
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,389
Look, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

186
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:36,328
Look, I think I've given you
the wrong impression.

187
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:39,265
- Larry's anus is fine.
- Shut the fuck up, okay?

188
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,165
Shut the fuck up!
Sorry.

189
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:43,602
All I'm saying is, don't take
any chances here, okay?

190
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:45,538
- This is serious, all right?
- Yeah, no.

191
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:47,336
- Good, 'cause I care about you--
- Yeah, thanks.

192
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,240
- --not just 'cause--
- Good to see you.

193
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:50,938
- And you.
- I'm gonna call Richie right now.

194
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:52,673
- Thanks, Ant--
- Antoinette.

195
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:54,305
- Yeah.
- I'll take care of that.

196
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,078
- Okay, thank you, Larry. Thanks so much.
- Okay.

197
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:03,123
Hi, it's Richard.
Leave a message.

198
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:05,182
Hey, Richard, it's Larry.

199
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:07,194
Matt Tessler
just asked me

200
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:09,093
to recommend him
for your pilot...

201
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,462
...so this is me calling

202
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:13,763
to recommend--

203
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:15,826
"recommend" him.

204
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,634
So in case
he ever asks you

205
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:21,972
if I recommended him,
you can tell him

206
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,273
that in fact I did

207
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:27,304
recommend him.

208
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:29,213
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

209
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,588
- Hi.
- Hi.

210
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:36,886
Just sign in, please,
and have a seat.

211
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:38,516
Shouldn't be too long.

212
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,993
I have a little problem
with this--

213
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:44,660
these sign-in sheets,
you know.

214
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:47,224
My name's right
out in the open here.

215
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:50,431
It's a bit
of a privacy issue.

216
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:53,133
There's no shame
in having to come

217
00:08:53,174 --> 00:08:54,971
to the gastroenterologist's
office.

218
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:56,840
It's a little embarrassing
maybe, you know.

219
00:08:56,877 --> 00:08:59,107
We could just put a sign up
on the wall saying,

220
00:08:59,146 --> 00:09:02,172
"Larry David was here."
Why don't we do that?

221
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:03,843
You know,
I have to tell you

222
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:05,283
I've worked here
for four years

223
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:07,014
and I've never had
anyone come in

224
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:09,579
and, like, cruise the list
of patient names

225
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:11,216
for any reason.

226
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,558
What if you are
in charge of this, okay,

227
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,290
so this is down here?
You keep that.

228
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,957
I don't like that.
First of all,

229
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,728
I only get paid
$9 an hour,

230
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,962
so it's a little more responsibility
than I'm used to,

231
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:23,436
to keep track
of patients.

232
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:25,598
Second of all,
I can't even make decisions.

233
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,232
You have to take it up
with the home office.

234
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,971
I would like to take it up with
the home office. See, you didn't think

235
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:32,445
- I was gonna take you up on that.
- No, I did think you were.

236
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,449
- You strike me as that type.
- Well, things like this interest me.

237
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:38,884
I'm not an inventor,
but I'm an improver.

238
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,819
I improve things
that are broken.

239
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:42,482
This is broken.
This system is broken.

240
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:44,150
I'd like to improve it.

241
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,853
Great. I'm assuming you're
a new patient,

242
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:48,555
'cause I think I would
have remembered you.

243
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:50,826
- So please fill that out.
- Okay.

244
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,365
What would you do
if I sat there, huh?

245
00:09:57,405 --> 00:10:00,431
You'd be a little freaked out if I sat there,
wouldn't you, honestly?

246
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,443
- A little bit. A little bit.
- I think a lot.

247
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,468
Yeah, that's
a little creepy.

248
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:06,707
What are you reading?

249
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:09,011
It is called
"Showbiz Insider."

250
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,712
- Really?
- I like to feel like an insider when--

251
00:10:11,752 --> 00:10:14,949
- Pretty heady stuff. Wow.
- Yes, very heady stuff.

252
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,116
Many are called.
Few are chosen.

253
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,558
You must be
very very bright.

254
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:21,720
Yes.

255
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:23,923
Where are you from,
New York?

256
00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:25,932
- I'm picking up an accent.
- Yeah.

257
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:28,161
Yeah.
You from New York?

258
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:29,567
Yeah.

259
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:33,398
But I'm not a Jew,
if that's what you're thinking.

260
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,970
'Cause I saw
your wheels spinning.

261
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,777
That's uncanny. It's like there's
a window into my soul

262
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:42,339
and you can just
really read me.

263
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:44,146
I read you
loud and clear, sister.

264
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,653
- Yes.
- Yeah.

265
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,314
Are you okay, by the way?
Do you have any--

266
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,154
you have some terrible medical problem
that brought you here?

267
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,592
I'm fine.
Checkup.

268
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:56,528
- Checkup?
- Mmm.

269
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:58,964
Hmm, really?

270
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,660
You?

271
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,293
- Checkup.
- Really?

272
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:04,566
- Yeah.
- Huh.

273
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:07,005
- How about that?
- Let me ask you a question:

274
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,941
did you ever go out
with a bald guy?

275
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,671
- Yeah.
- How did you find it?

276
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,305
It was magical.

277
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:16,441
- Yeah? See?
- Yes.

278
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:19,612
How am I doing
on the flirt so far?

279
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:21,621
- How would you assess it?
- Um...

280
00:11:21,655 --> 00:11:24,146
- Pretty good?
- I'm-- well, 7.5.

281
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:25,988
- 7.5? Really?
- 7.5, yeah.

282
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:28,494
- You're tough.
- Larry David?

283
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:29,894
- You're up.
- All right.

284
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,125
Well, they have
called for me.

285
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,599
Larry?

286
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:36,728
I guess I'll go in
for my checkup.

287
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:40,432
- Checkup.
- Nice talking to you.

288
00:11:40,474 --> 00:11:41,998
Good luck.

289
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:45,201
So long.

290
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:49,449
Hello, Mr. David.
How are you?

291
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:51,678
- Good.
- Good. All right.

292
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:54,279
Oh, you know my cousin
Matt Tessler.

293
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:55,788
Oh, Matt's your cousin?
Oh, yeah.

294
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:57,757
Oh, right.
Oh, thank you for this...

295
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,316
Yeah, sure sure sure.

296
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,385
So let me ask you,
Mr. David,

297
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,260
why are you here
to see the doctor?

298
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:05,891
Um...

299
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,299
I'd just as soon
tell the doctor.

300
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:10,803
It's okay. I've got to take all
the information first

301
00:12:10,838 --> 00:12:13,500
and I give it to the doctor. So why don't
you tell me the reason you're here?

302
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,475
I know, but if the doctor's
gonna come in here,

303
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:17,568
why not just tell the doctor?
I don't see why

304
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,977
I need to tell you and--
then you have to tell the doctor.

305
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:22,448
- Well...
- Why not just tell him directly?

306
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:24,542
I'm going to New York.
Why am I stopping off in Florida?

307
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:27,281
Mm-hmm. Policy is that I take
the information down first

308
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:29,721
and I give it to him.
He'll come in and go over this.

309
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:31,554
So he'll have it all
written down.

310
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:33,287
He won't have to go through
all of the questions again.

311
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:35,522
- This whole thing is askew, your system.
- Mm-hmm.

312
00:12:35,563 --> 00:12:37,929
The doctor should be in here right now.
We could be saving time.

313
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,660
He's got other patients
that he's dealing with,

314
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,567
so what I'm here-- I pretty much
cut the time in half with him.

315
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:44,969
Cut the time in half?
So you intercept him in the hall?

316
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:46,802
He's gonna get the information
and then what,

317
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:48,900
run to the internet
to look it up? No.

318
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:51,810
- He's gonna hear it from you.
- Doctors and nurses work hand in hand.

319
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:54,076
I just need the information.
If you could just give it to me--

320
00:12:54,114 --> 00:12:56,309
I'm not that comfortable
telling you, frankly.

321
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,113
I need to take it down
before I can leave.

322
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,781
Okay, I have a gerbil
up my ass.

323
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,791
That's my problem.

324
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,058
How long
has it been there?

325
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:13,157
Two days.

326
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,061
Okay, thank you.
The doctor will be right with you.

327
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:19,095
Fine.
Happy?

328
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,973
- Mr. David.
- Hello, Doctor.

329
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,979
- Larry, nice to see you.
- Okay.

330
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,981
I was wondering
if you could tell me

331
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,506
what seems to be
the problem.

332
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:46,860
Hey, what happened--

333
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:48,766
what happened
to the sign-in sheet?

334
00:13:48,802 --> 00:13:51,134
Oh, I called our
corporate headquarters

335
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:52,968
off your suggestion
and they loved it.

336
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:55,498
- So there's a new policy.
- What?

337
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,511
It's private,
just like you wanted.

338
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,604
No no no,
I don't want that.

339
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:03,048
You're listening to me?
I don't know what I'm talking about.

340
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,074
Put the sign-in sheet
back on.

341
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:07,280
- I can't. No.
- What?

342
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:08,788
You can't see this now.

343
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,886
First of all, I've got
to tell you something,

344
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:15,896
- okay?
- Yes.

345
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,898
I want to apologize

346
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:20,127
for the way
I behaved earlier.

347
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,135
Mr. David,

348
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,501
you don't have to
play games with me.

349
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:26,096
- I don't?
- No.

350
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,870
Are you looking
for Christopher?

351
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,570
No.

352
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:33,102
- Andrew?
- Keep going.

353
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:34,307
Paula?

354
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:36,009
Aha.

355
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,644
- You cannot tell. I could get fired.
- No no no, never.

356
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:41,154
- No no no no.
- I have no formal education.

357
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:43,247
- No no no no no.
- Okay.

358
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,758
Be careful.

359
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,818
- Thank you.
- She looks like a live wire.

360
00:14:50,164 --> 00:14:52,132
- You called her?
- Yeah.

361
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,600
So where are you going
to take her on a date?

362
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:56,159
I'm gonna take her
to the movies maybe.

363
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:58,137
That's great.

364
00:14:58,172 --> 00:15:00,140
The question is,
why was she at that--

365
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:02,142
what kind of doctor
was that again?

366
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:04,303
- Mm, gastroenterologist.
- So what was she doing there?

367
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:05,778
- That's the question.
- Oh my God.

368
00:15:05,813 --> 00:15:07,405
Why was she there?
I don't know.

369
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,416
I hope she doesn't have
the same thing I do.

370
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,441
Well, that's a good thing.
It'll go away.

371
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:13,009
Yeah.

372
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:14,520
Let me ask you
a question:

373
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:17,080
How much will you give me
to start gargling now?

374
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,285
- 50 bucks.
- You'll give me 50 bucks?

375
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:20,953
- 50 bucks.
- Take it out of your pocket.

376
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:23,054
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

377
00:15:23,097 --> 00:15:25,395
Just do it.
What, you don't trust me?

378
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:30,534
Here you go.

379
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:34,131
- I just got 50 bucks.
- No, now that doesn't count.

380
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:36,165
- No, you can't do that.
- No, what are you talking about?

381
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,678
I would have paid that happily.
It was so enjoyable.

382
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:42,443
It was so enjoyable and you ruined it
with "I just got 50 bucks."

383
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,077
Let me ask you a question:
Tessler's still one of your clients?

384
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:47,451
Yeah. He's coming
to the bat mitzvah.

385
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,251
You know who else is coming
to the bat mitzvah?

386
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,881
My newest client
John Legend.

387
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:53,688
He's a huge R&B singer.

388
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:55,217
I have no idea
who this guy is.

389
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:57,196
- Do you know who anyone is?
- No.

390
00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:58,960
When was the last time

391
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,694
- you bought an album?
- 1972?

392
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:03,259
- '72? So you know no one.
- No, I know nothing.

393
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:05,669
Anyhow, he's my client now.
He's coming

394
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:08,072
to the bat mitzvah.
He's gonna sing.

395
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:10,406
Well, maybe I'll bring
this woman.

396
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:13,038
You know, if we get along tonight,
I'm gonna ask her.

397
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,480
'Cause you gotta bring somebody.
Cheryl's coming with that guy.

398
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,313
- You gotta be there with somebody.
- Absolutely.

399
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,319
Why don't we
double-date tonight?

400
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,514
You know what? Susie and I were
talking about going to the movies.

401
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:22,783
You're kidding.
Let's do it.

402
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:24,154
Perfect.
I can check her out.

403
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,187
I haven't dated in a while.
Who pays?

404
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,029
- You pay.
- Don't be ridiculous. You pay.

405
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:35,831
- I do?
- Yes, you pay.

406
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,099
- Larry's not used to dating.
- Clearly, yes.

407
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:40,606
- No, I haven't dated in a long time.
- No, a long time.

408
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:44,202
What do I do? Am I allowed
to hold hands during the mo--?

409
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:46,542
- I don't know if there's rules--
- Is there a rule?

410
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,243
Excuse me.

411
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:52,252
Thank you.

412
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:54,447
Hi.

413
00:16:54,488 --> 00:16:58,686
One movie.

414
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,717
Thank you.

415
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:07,558
- Don't you want to sit on the aisle?
- No.

416
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:09,899
- I was being nice.
- Center's better.

417
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:12,269
Center? Why? You think
there's a big difference

418
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:13,933
- over there from here?
- Yes, this is good.

419
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:16,033
As long as a giant man
doesn't sit

420
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,271
- in front of me.
- Or a giant woman.

421
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:21,178
- Oh my God.
- What?

422
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:23,183
This guy.
That's the guy

423
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:25,515
who walked past the line
to get his ticket before.

424
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:27,349
- Oh, yeah.
- Pete!

425
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:28,877
- Look at him.
- I think it is.

426
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,015
Oh my God.
He was faking.

427
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:32,491
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

428
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:34,494
That's really good.

429
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:36,393
- Oh my God.
- Holy shit.

430
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,295
I gotta
take my hat off to him.

431
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,800
I gotta tell ya,
that's pretty good.

432
00:18:02,055 --> 00:18:03,215
Are you okay?

433
00:18:03,257 --> 00:18:05,122
Yeah, I'm fine.

434
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:07,059
Why? Why are you
asking me that?

435
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:09,085
No reason.

436
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:16,836
Everything okay
with you?

437
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,838
Yeah, fine.

438
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:20,032
Are you sure?

439
00:18:20,073 --> 00:18:22,268
Yeah.
Why shouldn't it be?

440
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,277
It's just you're
squirming a lot.

441
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,676
You're squirming
more than I am.

442
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:27,043
Well, my seat
is uncomfortable.

443
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,741
Yeah, my seat's
uncomfortable too.

444
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:31,182
I know.
We're in agreement.

445
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:33,118
Why did you say
you went

446
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,916
to that
gastroenterologist's again?

447
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:36,752
- I was there for a checkup.
- A checkup?

448
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,883
- Yes. Why do you keep asking me that?
- I've never heard

449
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:41,394
of anybody going to
a gastroenterologist for a checkup.

450
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:43,396
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

451
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,398
That's what you were
doing there.

452
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:47,696
- Is that what I said?
- Yes, that's what you said.

453
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,905
Honestly, I'm just really kind
of bored with this movie.

454
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:57,073
It's not so bad.

455
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,840
I really want to go.
Can we go?

456
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,575
Please.

457
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:03,583
Are you gonna
drag me out of this movie

458
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:05,346
with five minutes to go?
That's insane.

459
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:08,786
It's not five minutes.
This is the world's worst film

460
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:10,881
I've ever seen
and I really want to go.

461
00:19:10,924 --> 00:19:12,755
Come on,
five more minutes.

462
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:15,921
What do you gain by staying?
You don't care about this story.

463
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:17,453
I finish
things I start.

464
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:19,021
Books-- they could be
500 pages,

465
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:21,091
once I start them,
even if I hate it, I'll finish it.

466
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:23,102
I have friends
who I can't stand,

467
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:26,071
you know,
for, like, 25 years.

468
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:28,074
I'm still friends
with them.

469
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:29,871
Why?

470
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,435
Because I stay to the end,
till they're dead.

471
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,709
I go down with the ship.
That's what I do.

472
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:36,716
I'm not even the captain,
I'm going down with the ship.

473
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,581
That's how I want you
to think about me:

474
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,587
I'm the guy who keeps
the captain company.

475
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:45,922
I can't watch this.

476
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:50,921
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

477
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:52,955
- Where is she going?
- I don't--

478
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:57,397
- She was bored.
- It's almost over.

479
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:58,904
I know.
I told her.

480
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:00,566
It's five minutes to go.
It's crazy.

481
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:02,268
You'd better
go out after her.

482
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,368
- She's not gonna wait for you.
- You don't expect

483
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,709
somebody else to leave
if you're walking out of the movie.

484
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,841
- You don't understand women.
- You don't understand etiquette.

485
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:11,874
Fine.

486
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,494
- Where is she?
- She's not here.

487
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:31,663
- Are you surprised?
- Can you believe it?

488
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:33,935
- Yeah, that's rude.
- I told you she was gonna leave.

489
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:35,965
- That was completely rude, unbelievable.
- By the way,

490
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:38,000
I timed it. There were six minutes
left in that movie.

491
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:40,673
Irrelevant, Larry.
She was not gonna wait for you.

492
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:43,114
I invested an hour and a half.
I'm supposed to leave

493
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,380
- with six minutes to go?
- The last six minutes. That's craziness.

494
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,751
So, fine. You were right
and now you're alone.

495
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,349
Yeah, well, she has a tickle
in her anus anyway.

496
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:54,360
- She has a tickle in her anus?
- I think so. She was squirming in her seat.

497
00:20:54,394 --> 00:20:55,725
I don't wanna hear it.
Let's go.

498
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:57,559
You know what?
That movie stunk, by the way.

499
00:20:57,597 --> 00:21:00,964
No, it was great.
You're crazy.

500
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:02,559
So you're not gonna go
to the bat mitzvah?

501
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:04,467
Eh, I don't want
to go by myself.

502
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:06,438
And Cheryl's gonna be there
with this guy.

503
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,304
So we'll get you
a date--

504
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:11,368
my next-door neighbor.
She's a belly dancer.

505
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:13,140
She also was
in Cirque du Soleil.

506
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,943
Yeah, that's the one
with the nose rings, right?

507
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,576
- She can take 'em out.
- Then there's a hole in the nose.

508
00:21:17,617 --> 00:21:19,346
We'll just cover it
with makeup.

509
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:22,378
Blech!

510
00:21:22,422 --> 00:21:24,083
Do you want any coffee?
I'm gonna go get coffee.

511
00:21:24,124 --> 00:21:26,149
No, I don't want
anything.

512
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:29,492
This way. This is the one I was
telling you that I think is just perfect.

513
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:31,724
- This is great.
- Yeah, available the first of the month.

514
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:33,596
All we need is your signature
on the paperwork.

515
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:36,101
- That's great. Two months upfront?
- Upfront.

516
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:38,536
- Two parking spaces. It's all yours.
- How do you heat it?

517
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:40,802
Oh, you've got your own thermostat
right there, see?

518
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,810
I've got to take this.
Will you excuse me for one second?

519
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,745
- I'll be right back.
- Sure. Yeah, okay, good.

520
00:21:47,748 --> 00:21:49,181
Hi, I'm just--

521
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:51,343
Hello!

522
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:54,081
- How are you?
- I'm-- I'm good.

523
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:56,749
Are you
renting the office...

524
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,917
- ...next door?
- I'm thinking about it.

525
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:02,918
That's very good.
We'll be friends.

526
00:22:02,963 --> 00:22:06,330
Well, you know,
I'm looking at several places.

527
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,561
- I should probably catch up--
- We'll go to lunch together.

528
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:10,536
- Yeah.
- Every day, every day.

529
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,061
- Every day.
- Every day, lunch.

530
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:15,301
Uh, listen,
you're probably busy.

531
00:22:15,342 --> 00:22:16,969
No, I'm not. I have nothing
to do here.

532
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,205
I've got to find the office manager.
Thank you.

533
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:21,111
Goodbye.
Bye.

534
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:23,309
I hope you rent
the office.

535
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,784
Larry, wh--?

536
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:27,912
- Oh, hey.
- Am I interrupting something?

537
00:22:27,954 --> 00:22:29,421
No.

538
00:22:29,456 --> 00:22:31,424
I just came by
to say thanks

539
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,358
for the recommendation.
I got the gig.

540
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,020
- You got the job?
- Yeah.

541
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,530
What's this about?
Is this supposed to be funny?

542
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,895
No no no.

543
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:41,332
Someone was gonna
rent the office next door...

544
00:22:41,368 --> 00:22:43,928
This is how you welcome him?
You use some humor?

545
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,734
No no no, it was a test to see
if he's a tolerant person.

546
00:22:46,773 --> 00:22:48,798
And anyone who's not
is no neighbor of mine.

547
00:22:48,842 --> 00:22:50,707
I know somebody who wouldn't
find this funny at all.

548
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,611
He's a 10-year-old boy named Max
and he lives in my house--

549
00:22:53,647 --> 00:22:55,808
- who's not gonna think that's so funny.
- Oh, Jeez.

550
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:57,817
This is what you do?
You sit on your ass

551
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:59,842
- making fun of retarded people?
- Oh, come on.

552
00:22:59,886 --> 00:23:01,683
- Un-fucking-believable.
- I was just, you know--

553
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:03,188
I'm really
disappointed in you.

554
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:05,350
I would rent an office
to your son.

555
00:23:05,392 --> 00:23:07,826
My son has an office
on the right hand of Jesus.

556
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:10,421
Hey, you know
what's really funny?

557
00:23:10,464 --> 00:23:13,627
A successful writer-producer
who puts gerbils up his ass for fun.

558
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:16,693
- What? What?
- I talked to Kai. I talked to my cousin.

559
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,931
- That's why you had to see the doctor.
- Oh, that's bullshit.

560
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:20,997
- 'Cause you have gerbils in your ass.
- I made that up, you moron.

561
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,100
- Why would you make that up?
- Because I didn't feel

562
00:23:23,143 --> 00:23:25,373
- like telling her what was wrong with me.
- That doesn't make any sense.

563
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:28,677
And you know what? I think a lot of people
would get a kick out of this.

564
00:23:28,715 --> 00:23:30,706
I really do.
Fuck you, Larry.

565
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,513
Let's just try it out
on the street.

566
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:34,986
- Hey, no, I made that up.
- Hey, wanna hear something funny?

567
00:23:35,021 --> 00:23:36,613
Hey, you wanna hear
something funny?

568
00:23:42,562 --> 00:23:45,326
So sorry.
Do we still have time to do it?

569
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:47,162
- I'm sorry.
- No. I'm late now.

570
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,065
- It's too late for lunch?
- It's too late for lunch

571
00:23:49,102 --> 00:23:50,660
and it's too late
for my career

572
00:23:50,704 --> 00:23:52,365
and you fucked me
with Tessler.

573
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:54,805
- He's not working out?
- He sucks!

574
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:56,968
- He doesn't know comedy.
- I know that, I know.

575
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,137
He should be
selling fabrics.

576
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:00,976
Why'd you hire him?

577
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:02,948
How d--?
You--

578
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,042
my friend of 47 years--
you recommended him.

579
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:07,451
Oh, I recommended him?
When I called you

580
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,546
I told you that he asked me
to recommend him...

581
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:11,113
- What--?
- ...so I'm "recommending" him.

582
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,648
I put quotes around it.

583
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:14,717
Why'd you "recommend" him,
Mr. Quotehead?

584
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:17,730
I thought that you would pick up that it was
a non-recommend recommend.

585
00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:20,392
You know, life is
very brief, okay?

586
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:22,401
And you know I need
a good series.

587
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:25,666
- Is life too short? You think it's too short?
- Yeah.

588
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:28,731
- It's too short, isn't it?
- But now my life is fucking way short.

589
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:30,606
- I'm sorry.
- You ruined my fucking pilot

590
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:31,941
because of your
recommendation.

591
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:34,446
I can see if it came
from a skinhead...

592
00:24:34,481 --> 00:24:36,449
- Yeah.
- ...or one of Ben Laden's people.

593
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:38,383
You call him
Ben Laden or Bin Laden?

594
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:40,113
I don't know.

595
00:24:40,153 --> 00:24:42,246
You called him Ben.
That's almost like a Jewish name.

596
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:44,086
That's true.
Ben Laden does sound

597
00:24:44,124 --> 00:24:46,024
- like a shirt-maker in Manhattan.
- Yes, I know.

598
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,050
"Let's go to Ben Laden's.
They got great collars."

599
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:50,085
Exactly, yeah.
Anyway, I'm--

600
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,064
- No--
- I'm sorry.

601
00:24:52,098 --> 00:24:54,259
Yeah, fine, fi--

602
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:57,265
It's true, isn't it?

603
00:24:57,304 --> 00:25:00,273
- Holy shit.
- What are you talking about?

604
00:25:00,307 --> 00:25:02,104
Did you stick a gerbil
up your ass?

605
00:25:02,142 --> 00:25:04,508
- 'Cause the whole fucking town--
- Are you out of your mind?

606
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,512
It's all over the set.
It's everywhere.

607
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,514
- And I said---
- Jesus,

608
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,176
this Tessler is spreading
this rumor about me

609
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,810
to get back at me.

610
00:25:12,852 --> 00:25:14,513
It's all over
the fucking city now.

611
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,351
It's gonna be
on the internet too.

612
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,357
It's everywhere.
It's everywhere.

613
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:21,884
Jesus Christ, did you see the way
that guy looked at me?

614
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:23,919
I'm sure he probably
read "Gerbil" magazine

615
00:25:23,964 --> 00:25:26,125
and you're
fucking on the cover.

616
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,293
Holy shit.

617
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:32,237
You know, I do have
a tickle in my anus.

618
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:34,240
Oh, really?

619
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:36,538
- Yeah.
- I gotta split.

620
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:42,438
Hi, Carol.

621
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,551
Carol,

622
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,485
it's not true.

623
00:25:48,888 --> 00:25:50,981
...some crazy shit.

624
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:52,992
- It's missing. And you hear this shit.
- Leon!

625
00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:55,392
Leon, I don't really think
he would do something like that.

626
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,089
- I don't think--
- You don't know, Loretta.

627
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,394
Think about it.
Look, the gerbil's missing, right?

628
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,525
And then you hear this shit's
going on. Come on now.

629
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:03,695
Add this shit up.
Add this shit up.

630
00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:06,228
Here he comes now. What's going on?
What's going on, Larry?

631
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,174
The gerbil got on the elevator, hit "up"
and went up your asshole?

632
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:11,643
- Is that what happened?
- Leon!

633
00:26:11,678 --> 00:26:14,977
I can't believe that this thing has already
gotten to this house,

634
00:26:15,015 --> 00:26:17,313
- that you would accuse me of that.
- Larry, where's the gerbil?

635
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,716
- I got your back. I don't think you did it.
- Thank you.

636
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:21,380
I didn't even want
that thing in the house,

637
00:26:21,421 --> 00:26:23,651
- much less put it up my ass, okay?
- Let him out, Larry.

638
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,750
So, wait a minute.
Are you saying you didn't do that?

639
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,125
Absolutely. Of course not.
Come on, that's insane.

640
00:26:29,162 --> 00:26:31,187
That's what I thought.

641
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:33,028
I'm still sick about the fact
that that thing is

642
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,761
running around
the house somewhere.

643
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,201
- Yeah, all right. Whatever, man.
- We're done packing.

644
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:39,034
- All right.
- All right, sweetness.

645
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:42,064
- Hey, y'all got everything together?
- Yeah, we're done.

646
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:44,838
- All right, that's good.
- You ready to roll?

647
00:26:44,878 --> 00:26:47,972
Wow, this is really
happening, isn't it?

648
00:26:48,014 --> 00:26:50,107
- Oh yeah, we're about ready to bounce.
- Yeah.

649
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,913
- When are you going?
- Tomorrow.

650
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:54,078
- Tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

651
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,055
Can you believe it?

652
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,718
- We're out of here, man.
- Oh my God.

653
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,354
- Wow.
- It crept up on you, right?

654
00:27:03,396 --> 00:27:05,387
You're gonna
miss us, Larry.

655
00:27:05,432 --> 00:27:07,059
We're gonna
miss you too, Larry.

656
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,000
All right, don't get my
waterworks going here.

657
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:11,162
- You know how emotional I am.
- All right, okay.

658
00:27:11,204 --> 00:27:13,365
We're gonna miss you, Larry.
That's deep.

659
00:27:13,406 --> 00:27:16,898
Yeah. All right, I've got to get ready
for a bat mitzvah.

660
00:27:16,943 --> 00:27:19,411
- What's that?
- It's a Jewish ceremony, you know.

661
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:20,936
- Oh.
- It's a big party.

662
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,073
You don't wanna
go with me, do you?

663
00:27:23,116 --> 00:27:26,210
- You want me to go?
- Yeah, come on.

664
00:27:26,252 --> 00:27:28,550
Sure, I'll go
with you, L.D.

665
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:30,283
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

666
00:27:30,323 --> 00:27:32,257
- A bat mitzvah.
- Yeah.

667
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:35,625
My little girl
is so perfect.

668
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,038
- Thank you. How are you doing?
- Naches to you.

669
00:27:52,078 --> 00:27:54,410
You saw the early rehearsals.
When you left

670
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:56,847
they had a run-through.
The network stormed out.

671
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,216
How in the fuck could my best friend
recommend such an asshole?

672
00:28:00,253 --> 00:28:03,120
- Why didn't you say you didn't like him?
- Any normal person

673
00:28:03,156 --> 00:28:04,953
would have picked up
on what I was trying to say.

674
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:06,982
Now I'm abnormal.
Oh, now I'm not normal.

675
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:08,994
Yeah, you are abnormal.

676
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:11,292
You're the most abnormal,
jerky nutcase

677
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:13,162
I've ever met
in my entire--

678
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,759
- you think you're more normal than me?
- Fuckin'-A I am.

679
00:28:15,802 --> 00:28:17,793
I'll have a mental patient face-off
with you any day.

680
00:28:17,837 --> 00:28:21,329
- Oh, really?
- Larr, did you stick a gerbil up your ass?

681
00:28:21,374 --> 00:28:23,535
- Who told you that?
- I'm not gonna tell you who told me.

682
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,908
- It's not important.
- Of course I didn't stick a gerbil up my ass!

683
00:28:25,945 --> 00:28:28,209
- Don't get so upset.
- I'm upset!

684
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,011
- He's telling everyone.
- Yeah, he sure is.

685
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,142
Oh my God.

686
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:40,918
On behalf of my
wonderful wife Susie

687
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,428
and myself
I want to welcome you.

688
00:28:43,463 --> 00:28:45,522
Thank you all so much
for coming.

689
00:28:45,565 --> 00:28:48,033
It means a lot to us,

690
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:50,433
a lot to Sammie,

691
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:54,406
I can tell you that.
We're very proud of her.

692
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,409
I don't want
to embarrass her,

693
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,411
so I'm gonna keep this short
and just say

694
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,413
thank you from the bottom
of our hearts.

695
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,915
What we're gonna do
right now is open it up

696
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,247
to anybody who'd like
to say something,

697
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,186
make a toast, whatever.
Come on up.

698
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:10,621
- Yeah, I'm gonna--
- Larry.

699
00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:13,854
- I'd like to say something.
- All right.

700
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:17,658
Hey.
Um...

701
00:29:17,697 --> 00:29:21,531
well, first of all,
I'm so thrilled

702
00:29:21,568 --> 00:29:23,968
to be here at Sammie's
bat mitzvah tonight.

703
00:29:24,003 --> 00:29:26,335
- Thank you, Larry.
- This is a fantastic occasion.

704
00:29:26,372 --> 00:29:28,567
You know,
I've known Sammie

705
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:31,076
since she was born,
actually.

706
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,975
- I was in the hospital, remember?
- Yeah.

707
00:29:33,012 --> 00:29:34,946
I was in the hospital
that day

708
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,711
and I saw her when she was,
like, five minutes old.

709
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,877
It was not a pretty
sight for me.

710
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,353
It was the first time I ever saw
one of those things, you know.

711
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:44,948
Um, anyway, what I really want
to talk about tonight

712
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,757
is that
there's a guest here

713
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:51,355
spreading a vicious,
nasty, scurrilous rumor

714
00:29:51,397 --> 00:29:53,365
about me and a gerbil.

715
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,196
Okay? I'm sure
you've heard it.

716
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:58,227
And there's not a word of truth
to it, okay?

717
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:01,104
He has a personal vendetta,
so don't believe one word of that.

718
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,405
It's not true.
However,

719
00:30:04,444 --> 00:30:06,412
in the interest
of full disclosure

720
00:30:06,446 --> 00:30:08,414
I will tell you
that, um,

721
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:10,279
I do have a tickle
in my anus.

722
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:14,013
And they're slightly
related to each other.

723
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:16,021
What did he say?

724
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:18,455
The point is, it's not true.
I just thought it was

725
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:20,516
- important to say that.
- That's fine, Larry.

726
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,051
- it's not right that he would spread...
- Thank you very much.

727
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:25,758
- ...that vicious rumor.
- Larry, thank you very much. Enough.

728
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:28,028
What are you looking at,
Tessler?

729
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:30,331
I'll put
a fist up your ass.

730
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,895
How about that,
huh?

731
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:34,907
Well, um,

732
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:37,205
if anyone else
has a toast,

733
00:30:37,243 --> 00:30:39,234
something to say...

734
00:30:57,797 --> 00:30:59,788
I'll be right back.

735
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,528
- Hi.
- Hello.

736
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,369
- How are you doing?
- Nice to see you.

737
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,272
- Remember Glenn?
- Sure.

738
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:11,539
- Sammie looks cute.
- Yeah.

739
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,775
- Very cute. She's all grown up.
- Yeah, I know.

740
00:31:14,814 --> 00:31:16,782
- Oh, your underwear--
- Yes.

741
00:31:16,816 --> 00:31:19,512
- --got 'em on.
- My underwear? You're in the no-fly zone?

742
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,679
- I'm going right over the fence.
- You're over the fence?

743
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:23,313
- Over the fence.
- Did you miss the gate?

744
00:31:23,356 --> 00:31:25,256
- Not at all.
- Don't even think about the gate?

745
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,816
- Don't even think about it.
- That's wonderful. Thank you.

746
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,421
- You look good.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

747
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,993
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

748
00:31:37,036 --> 00:31:39,971
This one
goes out to Sammie.

749
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:41,473
Would you like
to dance?

750
00:31:41,507 --> 00:31:43,737
Um, yes. I mean,
if you don't mind.

751
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,767
- No, please.
- Would you excuse us?

752
00:32:30,723 --> 00:32:32,588
Would you care to dance?

753
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,616
Thank you.

754
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:24,170
Wake up, wake up!

755
00:33:27,246 --> 00:33:29,043
Get the ball, Daryl!

756
00:33:29,082 --> 00:33:30,811
Slide tackle,
number 2, Black.

757
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,317
- What, you're gonna cite that?
- Of course.

758
00:33:32,351 --> 00:33:33,841
What, are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?

759
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,114
Get out of here.

760
00:33:35,154 --> 00:33:36,985
Come on.

761
00:33:38,658 --> 00:33:40,853
Stop playing. Stop playing.

762
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,088
- Would y'all calm down?
- Hey, give me that.

763
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:44,892
- No.
- Don't make me come back there.

764
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:46,592
It's mine.
It's mine.

765
00:33:55,007 --> 00:33:58,135
Oh, fuck you, Larry.
Bullshit, motherfucker.

766
00:33:58,177 --> 00:34:00,270
- I didn't know.
- You are such a bald asshole!

767
00:34:00,313 --> 00:34:03,248
- I can't begin to tell you.
- Who the fuck you think you're talking to?

768
00:34:03,282 --> 00:34:04,749
Don't nobody talk
to my man like that.

769
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:06,775
You'd better get your ass
out of my house,

770
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:09,379
- you fucking bitch.
- Goodbye.

771
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,889
Get your smile on.
Get your smile on.

772
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,390
Get your smile on,
come on.

773
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,393
Am I smiling?
Here we go.
