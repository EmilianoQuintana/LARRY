Episode 5x05: Lewis Needs a Kidney

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,200
- Jones security.
- Larry David for Omar Jones.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,400
All right, Mr. David. What's this call regarding?

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,900
Uh, he... he'll know what it's about.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,400
I'm... I'm a client.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Got that, but what is the call regarding?

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,400
You know, to be honest, it's kind of personal.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,600
I'm sure it is.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,200
But you can't speak with him until you tell me what this call is regarding.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,100
But it has nothing to do with you. It has to do with him.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,900
I don't really wanna tell you what it's about.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,500
Ok, Sir, you're gonna need to control your levels and tell me what this call is regarding.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,800
Do me a favor, tell me the details of your last conversation.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,800
That's none of your business!

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Exactly.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, fuck.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,900
Schmuck! Fucking idiot!

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,700
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,700
- Hey, what's up?
- I locked myself out of my car.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,800
Oh, jeez.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
All right, I'll come get ya.

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,000
Welcome to jack in the box. May I have your order please?

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,900
I'd like, um...

24
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,000
two jumbo jacks,

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,900
french fries, and a diet coke.

26
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,900
Sir, are you in a car?

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,500
No.

28
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Sir, this is a drive-thru line. You have to be in a car to order.

29
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,100
- What's difference?
- It's our policy, this is a drive-thru line.

30
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
One second!

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come on, I'm starving. There's no... everything... everything's closed.

32
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,800
- I wish I could help you, sir.
- Oh, yeah, right.

33
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,900
Could you do me a favor? They won't let me order any food unless I'm in a car.

34
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,900
Will you... ?

35
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,100
They won't let me order any food unless I'm in a car.

36
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,100
- Would you mind if I...
- No, I'm sorry.

37
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Thanks.

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,900
I'm so sorry to bother you.

39
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,900
I'm trying to get some food. They won't let me order unless I'm in a car.

40
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,600
- No kidding.
- It's crazy.

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,900
Huh? It's just insane.

42
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,800
- I'll tell you what.
- Yeah.

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,700
- Get in.
- Really?

44
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,200
- Get in the car.
- Oh.

45
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,000
I tell you, Pete,

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,800
you should have got the jumbo jack.

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,300
- Do yourself a favor...
- Yeah.

48
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,100
The next time you come through,

49
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,500
go for the bacon bacon cheeseburger and the asian salad.

50
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,300
A strange combination, but it goes down easy,

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,000
and it comes out fast.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't need to tell you more.

53
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,200
What kind of work you do, Pete?

54
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,000
Good question.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,300
I'm in...

56
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,300
I'm in a transition at the moment. I'm...

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,800
- I was involved in the dental field...
- Dental field?

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,800
- For about eight months.
- What'd you do in the dental field?

59
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Uh, I worked alongside a dental hygienist.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,700
Really? What does somebody do working alongside a dental hygienist?

61
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
I watched and worked closely with a dental hygienist.

62
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,300
- And...
- and what happened?

63
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
Um, we ran into some problems.

64
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,300
And I prefer to leave it at that.

65
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,500
- Okay.
- I found myself...

66
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,200
drawn to landscaping work.

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
It's... it's... it's...

68
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,500
it's a slow transition.

69
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,600
I'm... I'm...

70
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
- you got some porno back there?
- Yeah... well no, it's not mine.

71
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,800
That was... that was left by a couple of my co-workers.

72
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,900
- Boy, that's quite a collection.
- Yeah.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I had no idea that that was there.

74
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,900
I... that's not mine to begin with, so...

75
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
I find it all...

76
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,600
- Oh, hey!
- Jesus!

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,400
- Hey.
- You ready to go?

78
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,700
Scared the hell out of me.

79
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,500
- This is Pete.
- Hey, Pete, how you doing?

80
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,800
- This is Jeff.
- Jeff.

81
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you for helping out my friend.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,800
Okay.

83
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,200
So are you involved in "Seinfeld" as well?

84
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,600
No, no, no, no...

85
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
How do you fellas know each other?

86
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
- He's my manager.
- I'm his manager.

87
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,900
Okay.

88
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,900
Oh, man. Jumbo jack.

89
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,100
Did I tell you? Huh?

90
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,700
- Best thing ever!
- How unbelievable is that?

91
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,700
Unbelievable.

92
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry,

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,200
but I got some bad news.

94
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,700
- Oh. Lewis?
- Yeah.

95
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,100
- Kidney?
- Yeah, both of them.

96
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,300
- He's gonna need a new one.
- Oh, well,

97
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,300
- is there a donor?
- I don't know.

98
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,800
What's he gonna do?

99
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,900
I don't know.

100
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,400
He's gotta find somebody who can...

101
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,300
who can match.

102
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,700
You know, hopefully, he knows somebody who's...

103
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,200
got the right kidney for him and then it's a whole process of...

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,700
you know, first, the person who... has to be tested,

105
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,400
and then if they have the right kidney,

106
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,900
then they have the surgery...

107
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,100
- Can you believe it?
- Yeah.

108
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,100
No donor. No donor.

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, god. My luck.

110
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,400
With all the people I know.

111
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,900
Oh, god.

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What about your relatives?

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,600
They're the ones who're supposed to be doing it 'cause they have the same blood and all that.

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Didn't you have some idiot cousin living out here or something?

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
- Louis Lewis?
- Louis Lewis.

116
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,100
- Please.
- What about him?

117
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,000
Might as well be called Manson Manson.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He's a nutcase. He's... he works at jack in the box and...

119
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,600
Jack in the box. I was just there the other night.

120
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,100
Had a jumbo jack...

121
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,300
Pretty good.

122
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm glad you liked it.

123
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,100
So did you ask this Louis Lewis? What did he say?

124
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,900
He says he wants to donate all of his organs after he dies,

125
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,500
but not a minute before.

126
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,600
Thank you, Louis Lewis.

127
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,100
Doesn't help me any.

128
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,200
Schmuck.

129
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,900
I'm gonna have to get on that kidney list like everybody else.

130
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,300
Shit.

131
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,200
I mean, the only other option is if...

132
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,000
you know, if a... if a... if a good friend

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
or a buddy comes through. Then I'm golden.

134
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't know what to do.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,500
Just the test isn't gonna hurt you.

136
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,400
I gotta choose healthier friends.

137
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,900
This is no good.

138
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,300
The next time there's any sign of anything wrong with any of my friends...

139
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,300
if I think they're gonna be going to the hospital, any sign of anything, I'm just...

140
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,800
- I'm just gonna drop them like a hot potato.
- Smart.

141
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,000
And you too. I mean, as soon as you get sick,

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
- I'm out. You know that, right?
- I'm glad you're bringing it up 'cause it's...

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,500
- Well, I mean, come on.
- No, it's nice to know.

144
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,800
- Yeah, and I'm giving you...
- Although,

145
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,500
I thought that that's what the whole deal was.

146
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,400
- It's one of the reasons you get married.
- Normally, that is the deal, but we...

147
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,400
we're losing the sickness and heath clause.

148
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
- I'm out if anything's wrong with you.
- Okay.

149
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
- And look, same for you.
- Thank you.

150
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,200
- You go too, as soon as...
- I will.

151
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,100
- Okay?
- Okay.

152
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,600
- I can't be around illness.
- But for now?

153
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,100
- Freaks me out, okay?
- But for now?

154
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,700
It'll be such a nice gesture and he'd really appreciate it.

155
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
All right, I'll take the test.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,800
- I think you're doing the right thing.
- Yeah, great.

157
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,500
- He's going to feel very good about that.
- Yeah, I know.

158
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
You're a very sweet friend.

159
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,000
It's very sweet.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,400
Good night.

161
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,500
What are you doing?

162
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
How 'bout a nice snuggle here?

163
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,200
I know, but your snuggle always leads to sex.

164
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,700
So what's wrong with that? Why shouldn't it lead to sex?

165
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,700
Sometimes you just want to snuggle and you don't want to have sex.

166
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,400
What's the advantage of that?

167
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,100
Because it's nice. You connect and it's warm and sweet.

168
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,400
- Okay, let's just snuggle, come on.
- You can do that?

169
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,700
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Without it turning into anything?

170
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,100
- Yeah, we'll just snuggle.
- See? It's sweet. That's nice.

171
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,700
See...

172
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,400
How nice it is?

173
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,900
- Okay, what are you doing?
- What? What?!

174
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,200
- That's exactly what I'm talking about.
- What's the problem?!

175
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
- The ass is part of my snuggle.
- No, it's not.

176
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,200
- It is!
- Okay, then good night.

177
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,900
We'll snuggle another time.

178
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
It's just... it's just a lever.

179
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,300
Good night.

180
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,800
I'm using the ass as a lever to draw you in.

181
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,500
That's all.

182
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,300
and it gets... the snuggle tighter.

183
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,300
Good night.

184
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,800
- Richard Lewis's office.
- Larry David calling.

185
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Sure. What's this regarding?

186
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,900
It's regarding his kidney transplant.

187
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,600
What?

188
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
It's regarding his kidney transplant.

189
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Mr. Lewis is getting a kidney transplant?

190
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,600
What?

191
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,100
- What are you saying?
- He didn't say anything to me about it.

192
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,600
You didn't know about this?

193
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,700
- Are you kidding?
- Oh my god!

194
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
He didn't tell you this?

195
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,900
He didn't tell you that there was a problem with his kidneys?

196
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,700
- No, he didn't tell me anything!
- How could he have not told you about this?!

197
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,900
I don't know, but he didn't tell me anything about this!

198
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,800
Oh jeez.

199
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,700
You asked me what it was regarding!

200
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,300
I didn't know it was going to be about something like this!

201
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,300
But I... I wouldn't have said anything! You asked me!

202
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,500
I could have sworn he told... I figured he told you!

203
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,100
He didn't say anything to me.

204
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,800
Oh my god.

205
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
- Take it easy.
- No.

206
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,200
Could you tell him I called?

207
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
- Okay.
- Thanks.

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,100
What did you do to my assistant?

209
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,900
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

210
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,200
She's freaked out, she's having a nervous breakdown,

211
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,500
and I think she might even quit.

212
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
It's un-fucking-believable. Why would you do that?

213
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
She asked me what the phone call was regarding!

214
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,500
- It's personal!
- She asked what it's regarding, I told her!

215
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,900
Jeez, what am I going to do? She was a basket case.

216
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,500
Christ's sake.

217
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,200
What am I going to do?

218
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,400
Hey, um, first of all, I want to tell you that, uh...

219
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,900
I thought about our conversation and, uh...

220
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,500
I'll, uh,

221
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll take the test.

222
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
- Big fucking deal.
- That's it?!

223
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,000
I mean, you're my friend.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,700
Yesterday you should have jumped right on it.

225
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,400
You're right, you're right, but I'm making up...

226
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,900
I'm making it up now. I wanna take the test.

227
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,000
Just close your eyes and think if it was reversed

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,800
you'd be really bummed out.
- Let me do that.

229
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,800
I'm closing my eyes, but now I'm asking you...

230
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,100
the situation's reversed.

231
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,400
- I need the kidney.
- Yeah?

232
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,000
What are you saying? Would you take the test?

233
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,200
- I'd probably want to leap at it.
- Probably leap at it?

234
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,600
- I...
- You'd leap out the window.

235
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,000
Let me just say this: I would have gone on record at the deli.

236
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Hello.

237
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,700
Yeah, this is Larry David.

238
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,300
Yeah, I was at a jack in the box.

239
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,800
Yeah. Pete.

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,700
Oh, Christ. Really?

241
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,700
Well, what's the address?

242
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,300
So, um, you know, I've decided to take the test.

243
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,300
- The kidney test for Lewis?
- Oh, good for you.

244
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,400
That's really noble.

245
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,500
- It's the right thing to do.
- Yeah.

246
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

247
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,900
I was kind of wondering why you're not doing it.

248
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,000
- Why should I do it?
- Well, you're his manager.

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,900
You're his friend. Why shouldn't you do it?

250
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,800
A lot of people who have managers and friends need kidneys.

251
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,900
What does that have to do with anything?

252
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,900
I don't even know what that means.

253
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,800
- You're his friend. You're his manager.
- Yeah yeah?

254
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,700
You're close to him. You should be taking the test too.

255
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
You're his oldest and closest friend.

256
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,800
So it's a question of longevity? That's it?

257
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,500
Yeah, you're his oldest and closest friend.

258
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,900
- That makes the most sense.
- If you're married to your wife for three years

259
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,300
and I've known her for 20,

260
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,600
who should give your wife the kidney?

261
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,700
I've known her longer.

262
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,700
By your logic, I'm the one who should be giving your wife a kidney.

263
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,600
If my wife needs a kidney, you can give it to her.

264
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,100
Oh, okay, so it's longevity no matter what,

265
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,600
even if you're married to her.

266
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,900
No, I'm saying you seemed like you want to give her a kidney,

267
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,600
so I'm gonna let you.

268
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,800
You know, I'm loathe to mention this, okay,

269
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,800
but you are an employee of mine.

270
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,400
Okay, you're really reaching now.

271
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,300
- You're desperate, aren't you?
- A little.

272
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,200
Yeah, I know. You don't want to give up your kidney.

273
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,300
- No, why should I?
- I know. Well why should I?

274
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
- Why should I?
- Well, why should I?

275
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,000
- Cause if I am, you should too.
- When did that rule come into effect?

276
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,900
- What's wrong with it?
- It's not a good rule.

277
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,700
- It's a good rule.
- No, you have to draw a line.

278
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,400
Kidneys is past the line.

279
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,100
- Hey.
- Mr. Jones!

280
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,600
Mr. David, what are you doing here?

281
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,600
It's kind of a long story, but I had a burger with a...

282
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,900
at a jack in the box with some guy and now I'm his alibi.

283
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,600
Apparently, I've got to spot him in a line-up or something.

284
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,100
- I don't know.
- Right.

285
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,800
- Really, that's not the issue here.
- It's true, uh-huh.

286
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,400
- Actually, I have a bone to pick with you.
- Me?

287
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,400
I mean, do you have something against receptionists?

288
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
You know I called up,

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,800
I was very polite and respectful, and she wants to know what it's regarding.

290
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,000
- I don't see how it's her business...
- I had talk her into staying.

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm a private eye, not a psychologist.

292
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,200
She comes into my office crying,

293
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,900
you know, wondering what's going on.

294
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,400
She's a part of my business. There's a certain factor...

295
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,700
Still, it's not you.

296
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,900
I mean, what if you were a psychiatrist and she said "what is it regarding?"

297
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,800
- There's protocol.
- And I say "I'm planning on killing myself.

298
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,700
I want to talk to him."
- It helps me save time

299
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,500
and we like to ask those questions so that we're very prepared

300
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,200
when the phone call does get to me.

301
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Okay. I'm sorry if I did anything that...

302
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,500
Hopefully we can we can avoid these conflicts, you know?

303
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,300
How's the adoption thing coming?

304
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
I'm working on some things. I have some really nice leads

305
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,600
and I should have something to you soon.

306
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,000
- Really? No kidding.
- Pretty soon.

307
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,400
- Omar, good to see you.
- Hey, Ray, how you doing?

308
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
- How's Ellen?
- She's good. She's pregnant again.

309
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,200
- Really? Third one.
- You Mr. Greene?

310
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,400
- Mr. David.
- Mr. David. Ray.

311
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,900
- That's... that's Mr. Greene.
- This is Larry?

312
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,500
- That's Mr. Greene.
- I'm Mr. David.

313
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,800
- You guys ever do a line-up?
- No.

314
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Piece of cake. They can't see you and there's nothing to worry about. Come with me.

315
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,300
All right, gentlemen, if you'll come in, please?

316
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,700
I changed my mind.

317
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,200
- Move up to the glass please.
- I'll take the test.

318
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,300
- Really?
- Yeah.

319
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,000
- Wow.
- Yeah.

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,500
- Good for you.
- I'll take the test. Who knows?

321
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,600
You're taking the test, I'll take the test.

322
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,700
Gentlemen, could I have you step up to the glass please?

323
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,200
That's very nice, very nice. He'll be very happy.

324
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,500
- No hurry here.
- All right, there he is.

325
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,800
Second from the right. That's him.

326
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
- Number two.
- Yeah.

327
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,500
- You're certain of that?
- Pete.

328
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,600
- That's Pete?
- That's Pete.

329
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,200
- That's the gentleman you had dinner with.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

330
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,700
- What time of evening was this?
- 10:15.

331
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,100
- 10:15?
- Yeah, 10:15.

332
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,100
- That's a late dinner.
- My mother used to call it a late night snack.

333
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,600
Dinner's between 5:00 and 8:00 generally.

334
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,100
- And this was with number two?
- Yeah, 5:00 and 8:00.

335
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,200
You could start at 8:00 though.

336
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,900
You know who Peter is?

337
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,900
He's a...

338
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,200
he worked alongside of a dental hygienist. I know that.

339
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,500
- And he did some landscaping.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

340
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,700
Are you gentlemen used to hanging out with known felons?

341
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,800
'Cause number two is Peter Hagen,

342
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,400
aka Peter the Tork,

343
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,700
Peter the Crybaby,

344
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,200
Wendell the conspirator,

345
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,800
Joshua Lancel Stigmeyer.

346
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,300
You two gentlemen shared a meal

347
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,900
with number two on the 23rd...

348
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,400
approximately 10:15 P.M.

349
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

350
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,900
All right.

351
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Let him go. You're done here, gentlemen.

352
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
How do I let you talk me into this?

353
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,300
What was I thinking?

354
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Who needs this?

355
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,600
I have good news, gentlemen.

356
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,300
Both of your blood types are compatible with Mr. Lewis

357
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
for his kidney transplant.

358
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Good night, nurse.

359
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Good night.

360
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,300
It's just a saying.

361
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,400
- I never heard of it.
- It's an old one.

362
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
- That's nice.
- It is.

363
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,300
- I know it is.
- Do you?

364
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,800
- Do you?
- I do.

365
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,200
- Good for you.
- It is good for me.

366
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,600
- Oh you think so?
- I know so.

367
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,100
- I'm glad.
- So am I.

368
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,400
- That makes two of us.
- So you say.

369
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,900
So I did.

370
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,900
Well, how are we gonna decide?

371
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,800
we could...

372
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,200
we could play bingo.

373
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Bingo?

374
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,500
- You know, it's... it's fair.
- Me play you in bingo?

375
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
That's like asking me to play golf against Tiger Woods.

376
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,200
- Play you in bingo?
- What? It's fair... it's a fair game.

377
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,200
No, thank you. No. No.

378
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,400
Doesn't he have a... a cousin?

379
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,900
Louis Lewis.

380
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,800
What's going on there?

381
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,700
He doesn't want to give up his kidney until he's dead.

382
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,200
Louis Lewis.

383
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,800
All right, you know what?

384
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,300
We'll just let Lewis decide. How about that?

385
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,500
Fine, let Lewis decide.

386
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,200
- Yeah, sure sure.
- I'll abide by his decision. Will you?

387
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,100
Yeah, most definitely, most definitely.

388
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
- I'm for that, I'm for that.
- Okay.

389
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,000
- Let's shake on that.
- Sure sure.

390
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,300
Sure. No campaigning.

391
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,400
- No. No campaigning.
- No campaigning.

392
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,900
I don't want to find out you've been calling him up and saying,

393
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,200
- "Oh, he's a lot thinner than I am."
- Find out that I've been saying?!

394
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,400
Oh, I'm more likely to do it than you?

395
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,000
Hey, Mr. David.

396
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,000
First of all, I'm really sorry about the other day.

397
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,900
I really had no idea that you didn't know about that.

398
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,900
I'm... I never would have said anything, obviously.

399
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
Is he... is he in?

400
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
He's on the phone with Jeff right now.

401
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Well, what's it regarding?

402
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,200
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

403
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,200
- You didn't ask?
- Nope.

404
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,700
I wonder if he's campaigning in there.

405
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Oh, jeez.

406
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,100
- He didn't even tell me now.
- Now, you would have found out eventually.

407
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,100
No, you... you would have... oh, jeez.

408
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,300
I'm sure he was gonna tell you.

409
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,900
No, don't... don't cry.

410
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,500
Oh, poor thing.

411
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,300
Oh, jeez.

412
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,400
Oh my gosh.

413
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,900
Oh dear.

414
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,400
It's all right, it's okay.

415
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,900
Don't... don't worry.

416
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sure he was gonna tell you.

417
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah, no, don't worry.

418
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,500
There there, it's okay.

419
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,100
- Wait, what are you doing?
- What?

420
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,700
- What was that?
- What are you talking about?

421
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,000
What the hell, man? Why did you touch my hair?

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,400
I was consoling.

423
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,900
- I was consoling you.
- That wasn't consoling.

424
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,300
Touching hair is part of my consolation routine.

425
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,500
No, it's really weird.

426
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,000
- You're being really inappropriate.
- What? Inappropriate?

427
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,400
- Yeah, you were.
- Are you crazy?

428
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,800
Hey, what is this? Again?! Again?!

429
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,100
She's... she's crazy! I was consoling her!

430
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,600
- He was coming on to me!
- I wasn't coming on...

431
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,400
- Are you a sociopath?!
- I was consoling her and I touched her hair.

432
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,000
No you weren't! He was coming on to me!

433
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,500
- That's such baloney!
- I'm leaving.

434
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,700
I was consoling her. I touched her hair.

435
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,700
- I'm leaving.
- She thinks that's coming on, she's nuts.

436
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,300
What... what a whack job.

437
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,500
Are you kidding me?!

438
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,300
I was consoling her! I was touching her hair.

439
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,800
- That's ridiculous!
- Mm-hmm.

440
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,600
She thinks I'm coming on to her? Get out of here.

441
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Get the hell out of here.

442
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,500
- You think she's leaving or quitting?
- That's a good question.

443
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
I don't know. She said she's leaving.

444
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,300
- Oh, what a hassle.
- Is that leaving or quitting?

445
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,400
- I don't know.
- Same thing happened with Cheryl.

446
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,100
She said she was leaving. I thought she was leaving me.

447
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,100
She's just going out to have lunch with her friend.

448
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,100
Cheryl... right now, look at this... are you...

449
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,500
You really have evidenced some pretty erratic behavior.

450
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Get out of here. I was touching her hair. She's crazy.

451
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
- Unbelievable.
- So um...

452
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,500
Did you get the news?

453
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,700
- Thanks. Yeah yeah.
- How about that?

454
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,700
I'm a lucky man...

455
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,700
I'm a lucky man to have two of you guys come through for me. Thank you.

456
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,700
- Hey, far out.
- So there you go. You've got your choice.

457
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,700
- Two... two kidneys.
- Wow!

458
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,600
- Of course...
- I'm very grateful, man.

459
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,800
You know, I...

460
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
I am considerably older than him.

461
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,000
And I'm not gonna...

462
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I don't want to get into that whole game. But, you know, he's...

463
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,100
there's a difference when you're younger, obviously.

464
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,200
Nah, a kidney's a kidney's a kidney.

465
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,900
I'm not so sure about that, but you know, whatever.

466
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,500
His are bigger too.

467
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,700
It's a big hefty kidney, could just handle a big load I think, you know?

468
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,100
You could start drinking again if you wanted to with that thing.

469
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,500
- That, uh that...
- Well, you know in case...

470
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,300
hurts my feelings a little bit, buddy.

471
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,800
- 11 years sober.
- Maybe not that.

472
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,600
- Thank you.
- But, you know, uh...

473
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,000
that's all.

474
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And then the fact that, you know, there's a lot about me that

475
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,800
when I got out of college, you don't know about. I really didn't know you then, so...

476
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,700
Please, I've been through everything.

477
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,600
Well, I don't think you did what I did, but...

478
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,800
- Trust me. Times 30.
- Uh, you're not really getting my drift.

479
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,700
- Listen, it... you're both a match?
- Yeah.

480
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,400
I don't care how you figure it out. You know what? Flip a coin, man.

481
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,800
Eeny meeny miney moe.

482
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,300
What do I care?

483
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,800
- Okay.
- All right?

484
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,300
And stay away from her, will you?

485
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,000
Whack job.

486
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,900
I got to start with me.

487
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,000
Eeny meeny miney moe, catch a tiger by the toe.

488
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,600
If he hollers, let him go. My mother says to pick this one

489
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,900
and out goes y-o-U.

490
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,600
Start with me. Start with me.

491
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Start with me.

492
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,800
Okay, I'm gonna flip this coin and this will be the kidney decider, all right?

493
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,500
Why don't we do eeny meeny?

494
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,600
- I thought we were gonna do a coin flip.
- Let's do eeny meeny.

495
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,400
- We agreed on a coin flip.
- I think I'd rather do eeny meeny.

496
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,300
- Fine.
- We'll do eeny meeny miney moe.

497
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
- Let's just do it, okay?
- Fine.

498
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,800
- All right, go.
- All right.

499
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,200
And before we go, I want to say something to you guys and I mean this.

500
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,100
I admire the both of you.

501
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,100
What you're doing is an unbelievable act of friendship.

502
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,500
I just wish I had a kidney match so I could be involved.

503
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,900
Well, you haven't taken the test.

504
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,900
Are you ready to do eeny meeny?

505
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,600
- Yeah.
- Do you want to take the test?

506
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,300
No, I don't think I'm a match anyway. Let's just do eeny meeny.

507
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Who wants to be eeny?

508
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
- I'll be eeny.
- Yeah, you can be eeny.

509
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,900
- Okay.
- He'll be eeny.

510
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,200
How come you want me to be eeny?

511
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,700
No, it's good. You should be eeny.

512
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,700
That's what you want, right?

513
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,200
Don't you want to be eeny?

514
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,300
Want me to be eeny?
Do you want me to be eeny?

515
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,400
- I'll be eeny. I'll be eeny.
- Okay.

516
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,900
Okay, here we go.

517
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Eeny meeny miney moe, catch a tiger by the toe.

518
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,300
If he hollers, let him go.

519
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,200

520
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,600
and out goes y-o-U.

521
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,500
Yeah yeah yeah!

522
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,100
- What are you excited about?
- No, what do you mean?

523
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,300
- What are you so happy about?
- I won!

524
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,200
- No, you lost!
- Out goes y-o-u!

525
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
No, you lost! You're out. You're it.

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,500
No, out goes y-o-U.

528
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,100
- You're the loser.
- You're the loser.

529
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,800
- You're the loser.
- No, you're the loser.

530
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,100
- Tell him, tell him, tell him.
- Hold on a minute.

531
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,600
Out goes y-o... U give the kidney.

532
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,600
- You give the kidney.
- No no no.

533
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,000
You stupid idiots! You don't even know how to play eeny meeny miney moe.

534
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,500
- We're idiots?!
- I don't know how to play eeny meeny?

535
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,200
- Ya don't know the first thing about eeny!
- Y-o-U. You're out.

536
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,800
- No, I'm safe.
- What the hell is all this screaming about?

537
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
- Lose with dignity.
- All right, wait a second.

538
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,200
- We're playing eeny meeny miney moe, okay?
- Yeah.

539
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,900
- Out goes y-o-U.
- Right, you're it.

540
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,400
- Who's it?
- You're it.

541
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,900
- Out goes y-o-U.
- No, that person's safe.

542
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,900
- He's you.
- No, and out goes y-o-U.

543
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,800
You're it. You're it.

544
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,500
- You're it. You lose.
- You fucking idiots here!

545
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,700
What are we talking about anyway? Losing what?

546
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,800
They're giving a kidney to Richard Lewis.

547
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,300
- He's the one.
- He lost.

548
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
Excuse me, you're not giving your fucking kidney.

549
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,000
What if one your kids needs a kidney one day?

550
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,700
You're gonna give a kidney to Richard Lewis?

551
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,000
No no no!

552
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,100
- You'll give it to 'em.
- I might not be the match Larry.

553
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,800
He needs his kidney, number one. Number two, he's a fat fuck.

554
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,900
- He can't even survive the surgery.
- How do you know he can't survive the surgery?

555
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,100
You are healthy and thin. You're giving the kidney.

556
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
End of discussion, moot point.

557
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Out goes y-o-U.

558
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,600
So I'm out.

559
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,900
I'm the winner.

560
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,500
No, that means you're out and the other people stay in.

561
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,700
That's if you're playing with more than two.

562
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,700
If you're playing with just two people,

563
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,500
then the one who's out is the winner... out goes y-o-U.

564
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,900
I'm out, he's in.

565
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,100
- He's the winner.
- Have you ever played eeny meeny miney moe?

566
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,600
- Yeah, I have.
- Have you?

567
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,100
That's how it works.

568
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,600
Listen, I grew up with eeny meeny miney moe...

569
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,300
- grew up with it.
- I did too!

570
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,300
I know the rules of the game.

571
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,400
I think you're being a baby right now.

572
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,300
You know, it's totally unfair.

573
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,600
I take care of myself all these years...

574
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,400
the diet, the exercise, the whole thing,

575
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
for what?

576
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,300
I'd have been better off just eating crap and smoking.

577
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
That's what I should have been doing all these years...

578
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
eating crap and smoking.

579
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,900
Maybe this is why you were saved when you were drowning that day.

580
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,000
Maybe this is...

581
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
the reason.

582
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,700
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

583
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, he saved me so I can give up a kidney?

584
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,800
That's why?

585
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,300
If he wants to get so involved,

586
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,300
why doesn't he just fix his kidney tonight while he's sleeping...

587
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,700
instead of going through all this drowning-saving business?

588
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,400
Well, I think you're doing the right thing.

589
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,700
Don't you feel good about doing this for Richard?

590
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,400
- No.
- Yes you do.

591
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,100
I don't. I feel awful.

592
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,500
Think about how he's feeling right now.

593
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,900
He feels good.

594
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,700
- Well, doesn't that make you feel good?
- No.

595
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
- Well, you should.
- I don't.

596
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,300
- You're gonna be okay.
- I'm not.

597
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,900
- Yes you are.
- No I'm not.

598
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,900
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

599
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,900
- Really?
- Yeah.

600
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,900
- Aww.
- Thank you.

601
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,300
Okay, you're welcome. I'll be here.

602
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you...

603
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
- What are you doing?
- What?

604
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,200
- What?
- You're turning consolation into sex?

605
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,100
Well, that's the ultimate form of consolation.

606
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,600
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, sure it is.

607
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
Okay, just forget it.

608
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,600
You were consoling me and that's... that's consolation to me.

609
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,800
Sex is consolation.

610
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,900
Isn't that consolation? No?

611
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,300
This has been the third hold-up of a jack in the box

612
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,200
in the past two months.

613
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,400
Police believe that the suspect, Peter Hagen, is responsible...

614
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,900
Hey, that's that guy Pete... the guy I got out of jail.

615
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,600
The victim of the shooting in this case, a Mr. Louis Lewis...

616
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,600
cousin of actor-comedian Richard Lewis,

617
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,900
is in a coma and is not expected to survive.

618
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,800
This is Kelvin Han Yee live from Studio City.
