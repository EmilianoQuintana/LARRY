3
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:24,183
What is that?

4
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:26,284
I don't know.

5
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:29,717
What is that,
a cell phone?

6
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:47,983
God.

7
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,284
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

8
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:56,250
Oh, it's a smoke alarm.
The smoke alarm's going off.

9
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,717
It's the stupid batteries.
Come on, we've gotta find it.

10
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:05,517
No, it's not
that one.

11
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,550
It's not that one.

12
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:18,350
No.
Try the guest room.

13
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:24,284
I think
it's downstairs.

14
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:30,550
I don't think
I have any feeling

15
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,050
In my shoulders,
I swear to God.

16
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:33,950
- It does take its toll, man.
- Take its toll...

17
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:36,117
- you did very well, by the way.
- You don't have to condescend.

18
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:37,751
No, seriously, for a
guy who doesn't play,

19
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,651
I thought he did very well. You did.

20
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:41,284
You never play. What do
you want from yourself?

21
00:02:41,384 --> 00:02:43,183
- Give yourself a break.
- One thing I want to tell you,

22
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:45,083
- After you hit the ball six, seven times...
- Yeah?

23
00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:47,384
...And it's not in the hole,
just pick it up and we'll move on.

24
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:50,217
- You shouldn't take more than seven strokes.
- Yeah, that's just craziness.

25
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:52,384
Just pick up the ball.
He's right, yeah.

26
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:54,651
- Well, you'll never have to experience me again.
- No, we had fun.

27
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:56,017
Didn't you have fun
with us, hanging out?

28
00:02:56,117 --> 00:02:57,983
It was a little boring,
to be honest with you.

29
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,717
- That's a nice thing to say.
- Well, it fucking was.

30
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:04,684
Okay, give me back my $150
that I spent on your guest fee.

31
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:06,850
You paid $150 for me to
look like a fucking asshole?

32
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,217
More shocking footage

33
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:13,183
From hurricane edna which has left
extensive destruction in its wake.

34
00:03:13,284 --> 00:03:16,017
- These poor people. - The storm
surge inundated low-Lying areas

35
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:17,816
- Knocking out phone and power lines.
- Oh, boy.

36
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,584
That's from global
warming, that hurricane.

37
00:03:19,684 --> 00:03:22,384
33 deaths have been reported
and thousands left homeless.

38
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:24,217
Look at that... Thousands
of homeless people now.

39
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:26,350
Fema is estimating damage
from this category 5 hurricane

40
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,751
In the billions
of dollars.

41
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,384
Oh, wow. It's katrina all
over again. Poor people.

42
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:33,384
Did you go to Funkhouser's
party last night?

43
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:35,217
No. Did you?

44
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:37,417
No. Huh-Uh.

45
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,083
Why?

46
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:41,117
Because I'm going
to Danson's party tonight.

47
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:43,117
Two back to back...

48
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:44,950
I don't want to go to
two parties back to back.

49
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,950
It was a stupid night
for him to have a party.

50
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,484
- Yeah.
- Did you call him?

51
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:51,651
No.

52
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:54,584
- Well, what are you gonna say?
- I'll tell him sammy was sick.

53
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,751
You're gonna use your
child to get out of a party?

54
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,317
- Why not? It's the best thing in the world.
- It's a perfect excuse.

55
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,417
- No one can argue with that.
- Who argues with that?

56
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,684
I wish I had that. It's a
great reason to have kids.

57
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:06,017
It's a great reason to have kids.
It's one of the bonuses, yep.

58
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:09,584
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna say?

59
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:12,183
- You have nothing, nothing.
- I know.

60
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,417
I'll just show up tonight and
pretend I had the wrong night.

61
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:16,417
- That's stupid.
- That's great.

62
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:19,150
- Oh, please.
- No, that's fantastic. I love that.

63
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,317
Yeah. Ding-Dong...
"where's the party?"

64
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:23,150
- Isn't that a good idea?
- That's a great idea.

65
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:25,484
He's not gonna buy that.
That's such obvious bullshit.

66
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:27,384
No, it isn't. Nobody
would go out of their way

67
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,751
That much... To show up
at somebody's house,

68
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,417
Pretend they had
the wrong night.

69
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:32,950
He's gotta be a mental
case to believe it.

70
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,183
No, I love that.
That's fantastic.

71
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:37,217
Have you ever seen
Richard look in the mirror?

72
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:41,651
Is that really
what I do?

73
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:43,950
- You happy now?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,850
- All right, I'll see you at Danson's?
- Yeah.

75
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,517
- Okay.
- Thanks for turning me off to a sport forever.

76
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:51,217
It's okay. Are you gonna go tonight?

77
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:55,050
Uh, I don't know. I have
to ask cha cha. I'll see.

78
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:58,450
- Cha cha.
- Cha cha.

79
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:00,217
Where did he get her from? Man, oh, man.

80
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:02,517
- She is so hot.
- Good for him.

81
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:05,317
- Good for him.
- Yeah, good for him. Let him enjoy.

82
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:08,017
- She's somethin'.
- Yeah. Wow.

83
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,651
- All right.
- All right, my friend.

84
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:11,684
- See you at Danson's.
- I'll see you at Danson's.

85
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:14,751
Okay. What are you gonna wear?

86
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,684
I'm gonna dress like
a little Dutch girl.

87
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,617
"What am I wearing?"

88
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,983
I can't stop thinking
about the hurricane.

89
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,783
Oh, my nose is really itching
me and I can't scratch it.

90
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,050
I mean, the pictures on TV were just...

91
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,783
You can't even imagine
that people survived it.

92
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:36,150
I know,
it's awful.

93
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,983
Awful. I was watching it today.

94
00:05:38,117 --> 00:05:41,517
All these people... They
have no place to go right now.

95
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:43,517
Hey! Hey, dum-Dum,

96
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:45,517
Go ahead,
move in.

97
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:48,517
- Thank you.
- I mean, their houses were completely destroyed.

98
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:50,550
You know what my father
used to call those people?

99
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,717
Schmohawks. Did I ever tell you that?

100
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:55,350
- Yeah.
- Have I mentioned schmohawks to you?

101
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,183
Schmohawk.
"Hey, schmohawk!"

102
00:05:57,317 --> 00:05:59,417
- He used to yell it out all the time.
- Imagine for one second

103
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:03,150
If we lost... If you lost every
single thing you had in your life.

104
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,816
What do I have?
I don't know what's so...

105
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,050
- what do I have?
- This is... Well, there...

106
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,783
- I like this sport jacket. I can't replace this one.
- Listen, when there's...

107
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:11,584
You know what
some people are doing,

108
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:14,517
That I personally think
is a really great idea,

109
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:17,350
Is they're bringing in
displaced families.

110
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:19,150
- Hmm.
- You know,

111
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,150
I've been doing
a little research

112
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,617
And we could actually have
a family here tomorrow.

113
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,150
- What?
- Yeah.

114
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,017
- Tomorrow?
- They have no place to go.

115
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,284
I would need
a couple of months

116
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:31,183
To mentally prepare for that. Tomorrow?

117
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:33,083
We don't have
a couple of months.

118
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:35,350
These people
need help right now.

119
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,684
It's a nice concept.

120
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:41,816
Uh, you know,
we'll think about it.

121
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:44,183
We don't need to jump
into this thing right now.

122
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,450
Imagine how
they would feel

123
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:48,517
To come here
and live in our house.

124
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:50,883
Mmm. Oh, all right, we're here.

125
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:52,617
We're at funkhousers'.

126
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:55,517
Why aren't we just going
to Ted and Mary's, Larry?

127
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:57,384
This is so stupid.

128
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,384
- This is so stupid.
- What? Are you kidding?

129
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,017
There's nothing to it. We'll just
pretend we had the wrong night.

130
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,450
This way he feels good... That at
least we attempted to go to his party.

131
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,384
Can't we just go
to Ted and Mary's?

132
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:09,916
We're gonna go to Ted and
Mary's after we do this.

133
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:12,651
It won't take long.
It's two minutes.

134
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,783
- Hey.
- Hey, Marty.

135
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,317
What happened
to you guys?

136
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,717
Where...
where is everybody?

137
00:07:27,816 --> 00:07:30,284
You mean,
from the party?

138
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,717
Oh, they've been gone
for about 24 hours.

139
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:36,883
- The party was last night.
- Last night?

140
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:38,450
A great party. Oh yeah,
we had a lot of fun.

141
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,983
- Are you kidding?
- We never heard from you.

142
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,651
- Oh my gosh.
- The party was last night.

143
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:43,651
- We sent you an invitation.
- Oh, Marty.

144
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:45,916
Oh my God,
that is unbelievable.

145
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:47,816
- I guess we mixed up the dates.
- We missed the party?

146
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,783
- Totally missed it.
- How did that happen?

147
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:51,550
Oh, it was
a great party.

148
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:53,417
This may be the dumbest thing
I've ever done in my life...

149
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,717
- well, we've ever done.
- So you guys thought the party was tonight?

150
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:58,417
Yeah, obviously.

151
00:07:58,517 --> 00:08:00,083
Everyone else
was here.

152
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,751
You know what? I swear I had a
feeling. I really had a feeling.

153
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,317
- Anyway...
- Anyway, it's so good to see you.

154
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,684
- Tell Nan I'll call...
- We're gonna get...

155
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:09,684
No, look look look
look look,

156
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:11,684
You're here... Come on in. Come on.

157
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,584
What? Get out of here. We
don't want to impose on you.

158
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:15,684
You're not imposing.

159
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:17,584
You're tired from last night.
You were up late with your party.

160
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:19,651
- Get out. Are you nuts?
- Yeah, we wouldn't dream of it.

161
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:21,584
Don't worry. We've got
some food left over,

162
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:23,417
Got some games to play. Come on in.

163
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:25,017
No, but it's crazy.
We don't...

164
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,217
- we would not dream of it.
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.

165
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:29,050
You have no plans,

166
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,916
You're supposed
to be here,

167
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,050
And you're here.
So come on in.

168
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:38,250
Come on, Cheryl.
Come on.

169
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,083
Come on in.

170
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,983
Come on in.

171
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,617
Come on.

172
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:48,484
Come on, larr.

173
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:50,584
Come on, Larry.

174
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,883
Well, I'll

175
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,050
- You missed a great party.
- I'm sure, yeah.

176
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,950
- It was a lot of fun.
- Oh...

177
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,883
Mm-Hmm, mm-Hmm. I'm
sorry we missed it...

178
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:03,850
Yeah, well,
we didn't wanna miss it.

179
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,284
- Obviously, we're here.
- No, but you know what...?

180
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:08,284
Let me tell you
what we did.

181
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:10,584
We had
an hour and a half

182
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,050
Of the greatest
improv karaoke singing

183
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,150
- You've ever heard in your life.
- Oh, boy.

184
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,883
We're sorry we missed
it. And you know what?

185
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:18,850
- We shouldn't be here right now.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

186
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,150
- We really should go.
- No no no no no. I'm not heaping guilt.

187
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,950
- I think we're gonna get going.
- No no, don't go anywhere.

188
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,517
- No no no, sit down, sit down.
- We're gonna get out of here.

189
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:30,684
- Please, oh, stop it!
- Sit down!

190
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,684
Come on, sit down.

191
00:09:32,783 --> 00:09:35,783
I'm okay with it.
And stop feeling bad.

192
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:38,384
We're here now.

193
00:09:38,484 --> 00:09:41,250
You know what game I love
that we didn't play last night?

194
00:09:41,384 --> 00:09:43,150
It's... And we play it
for money...

195
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,950
"1000 pick-Up sticks."

196
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,183
I go get the sticks, I throw
them all over the room...

197
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:50,250
... And we pick up the sticks.

198
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,450
And the one with the
most sticks wins the pot.

199
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:54,717
- That sounds good.
- Are you expecting company?

200
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:56,717
Yeah, what is this?
You got company?

201
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:58,584
- Now we're intruding on your company.
- I'll get rid of them.

202
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:01,850
- Now it's really crazy.
- Please relax. I'll get rid of them.

203
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:05,883
Are you guys expecting company?

204
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,783
- Hi.
- Hey.

205
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:09,883
- What are you doing here?
- The party.

206
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,050
Where's everybody?

207
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,284
The party was
last night.

208
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,651
- What do you mean, the party was last night?
- What are you talking about?

209
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:21,450
- The party was last night.
- It's tonight.

210
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,550
Well, guess who else
thought it was tonight?

211
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:25,417
Who?

212
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:27,517
- What are the odds?
- Yeah, what are the odds?

213
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:30,150
- Oh my God, how about that?
- We're just gonna go.

214
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,350
They had the wrong night just like us!

215
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,617
- That's unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.

216
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,550
- No no no.
- See you later.

217
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:38,584
- Come on in.
- No. No, listen...

218
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:40,617
We're gonna have a little
get-Together tonight.

219
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:43,450
- No no, we'll go. Cheryl, we'll go.
- We'll go, we'll go.

220
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,950
We'll all go.

221
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,450
- Don't go anywhere.
- We'll go.

222
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:48,883
No, don't go anywhere.
Listen to me.

223
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,651
- We're gonna have a little party tonig.
- Well, not a party...

224
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,517
What the hell are you doing?
You stole my wrong-Night bit.

225
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:56,384
I didn't steal it.
I give you full credit.

226
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,384
It's a brilliant idea.
I told Susie

227
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,150
- It was your idea.
- We're never getting out of here.

228
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,017
- We'll be out of here in five minutes.
- Five minutes?

229
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,916
- Trust me. Five minutes.
- Let me tell you something:

230
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:06,916
There's no way you're making
Danson's party tonight.

231
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:09,284
- We are locked in here. This is it.
- "Locked in."

232
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,450
- Five minutes... We're out of here.
- Oh, really?

233
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,183
- Watch. Five minutes.
- Oh yeah? You watch.

234
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:15,916
So, is this
fun or what?

235
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,550
- The cake is wonderful.
- The cake is incredible.

236
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:21,183
- Best cake ever?
- Best cake I ever had.

237
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:23,183
Ever. And who's ever
had more cake than me?

238
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,450
- Exactly. He's right about that.
- Do you love that?

239
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,183
What is the deal? I've never
tasted anything like that.

240
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:29,017
- Everything is handmade.
- Where did you get it?

241
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:31,350
- I'm sucking on it like a mint.
- At a cake shop.

242
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:34,651
- What was the shop?
- That's a new way of eating cake... Like a mint.

243
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:35,916
Wait, I need
to find... Where?

244
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:37,717
26th street bakery,
we got it.

245
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:40,017
- You know Jeff... He can't stop...
- The texture.

246
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,651
All right, this has been...

247
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:44,617
- we gotta get going.
- Has this been better than you thought?

248
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:46,617
- We gotta get going.
- Yeah, thank you.

249
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:48,916
- No, I've gotta get going.
- No no, we gotta get going.

250
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:50,983
My daughter is waiting
for a puppet show.

251
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,083
- My dad has a virus. He's in bed...
- Larry's dad's got a virus.

252
00:11:53,183 --> 00:11:55,350
- ... With fever, with covers up to his neck.
- We shouldn't be here.

253
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,450
Your dad always
has a virus, okay?

254
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,717
- Fuck you, he doesn't always have a virus.
- Hold it one second.

255
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:01,850
You guys stay here, keep him company.

256
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,816
- We have to do something for sammy.
- You stay here then.

257
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:05,983
- You stay.
- You stay.

258
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,717
You stay.

259
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:09,384
- Oh.
- Hold it a minute.

260
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:11,183
You guys were supposed
to be here

261
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:13,183
To go to a party,
right?

262
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:15,384
You got nothing
going on.

263
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,651
Father sick,
puppets...

264
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:20,183
Tomorrow you'll take your
puppets over to his father's house

265
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,183
And make him
feel better, okay?

266
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,717
We're gonna have fun. And
guess what our next move is.

267
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:28,150
- What?
- We're going into the living room

268
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,050
And we're gonna play
"the newlywed game."

269
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,017
- Yes.
- Because we played it last night

270
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:36,117
And it was
spectacular.

271
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:37,850
Oh my God!

272
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,317
Yes, that's great.

273
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,317
Do I know my husband?

274
00:12:42,384 --> 00:12:44,651
- Unbelievable.
- You are good at this.

275
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:47,117
- Okay, next question.
- Okay, all right.

276
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:49,384
That was great.
"If you could have sex

277
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:52,284
With one of your friends'
wives or girlfriends...

278
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:54,183
... Who would it be?"

279
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:59,384
- That's a dangerous one.
- Okay.

280
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:01,651
- All right.
- Hold on, hold on.

281
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:04,651
- Tell me when you're ready. I'm ready.
- I think we got this.

282
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,550
- I'm ready.
- I'm ready.

283
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:09,317
- I'm gonna go first, okay?
- All right.

284
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:14,183
I will say, Cheryl,
that you are adorable.

285
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:16,484
Thank you.

286
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:19,017
Susie,
you dress great.

287
00:13:19,117 --> 00:13:22,183
Yeah, well,
that's my forte, Marty.

288
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:25,651
But when I really
think about it,

289
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:27,850
- I've gotta go with
my little poofer.

290
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,017
Look at the...

291
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:32,384
Oh my God.

292
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:35,183
- Oh my God.
- Oh, man.

293
00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:37,217
- Oh, God.
- That's cute.

294
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,584
- How about that? How about that?
- Isn't that great?

295
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,783
- Go go, I wanna hear yours.
- That is great.

296
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,783
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.
- Okay.

297
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,484
- You're next.
- All right.

298
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:50,317
I'm gonna go with...

299
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:52,783
- cha cha.
- Cha cha? Wow.

300
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,816
- Cha cha? Lewis's girlfriend?
- Yeah, cha cha.

301
00:13:57,317 --> 00:14:00,217
Oh my God, I had no idea
you had a thing for cha cha.

302
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:02,751
What are you talking about? I
don't have a thing for cha cha.

303
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,217
Richard's girlfriend?

304
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,916
- What?
- That was a dumb answer.

305
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:08,983
- Oh, stop it.
- I mean, I had no idea

306
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,350
That you've been... That you
wanted to have sex with cha cha.

307
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,550
I don't want to have sex with
her. I'm answering the question.

308
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:16,983
- What was the question, Marty?
- "Who do you want to have sex with?"

309
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,250
- Who did you put down?
- Obviously, there's a fantasy going down.

310
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,284
- Oh, get me involved now.
- Who did you say?

311
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:23,816
- Who were you gonna say?
- I was gonna answer Susie.

312
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,317
- Good answer.
- Oh, God, you're both full of shit.

313
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:29,617
- Exactly.
- You are full of shit.

314
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:32,350
- You are full of shit.
- I love my wife.

315
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,717
- Oh, you're all so good.
- I didn't even know about cha cha.

316
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:36,883
You love your wives.
Fuck you and fuck you.

317
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:40,617
Oh, you're the one
that's mad. I love it.

318
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,384
Come on, honey. I don't
care about cha cha.

319
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,384
I was trying
to win the game.

320
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:52,651
You thought she was sexy. I thought
that's what you would write down.

321
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:55,651
Cheryl, come on.

322
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:58,150
I don't...
come on, what can I do?

323
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,450
What can I do? I'll
do anything. Come on.

324
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,883
Anything?

325
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:06,883
Well, you know,

326
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:09,883
Short of adopting
this hurricane family.

327
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:17,484
I can't wait
to get to the airport

328
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,484
To see the family.
It's so exciting.

329
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:21,117
- Are you excited?
- Mmm.

330
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:23,983
We'll finally get to meet
them. They're gonna be so happy.

331
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:25,916
The guy on the phone was
saying how excited they were

332
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:28,284
When they got on the plane 'cause
they'd never been to L.A. Before.

333
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:31,450
I can't wait to see what they look
like. I know that sounds weird,

334
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,384
But I've been talking,
you know, to them...

335
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:37,916
...And about them,
you know...

336
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:39,983
Yeah.
I just...

337
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:44,550
I just want to make one
quick stop before we go.

338
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:50,584
- Hey.
- Hey.

339
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:52,651
What are you guys
doing?

340
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:57,350
What's...
what's going on?

341
00:15:57,484 --> 00:15:59,916
What do you mean?

342
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:02,816
- Where's everybody?
- We thought there was a party.

343
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,017
Oh my God, you thought
the party was tonight?

344
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:08,117
- Yeah.
- Last night.

345
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:10,350
- What?
- The party was last night.

346
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,384
- Are you kidding me?
- No, man.

347
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:14,816
- That's unbelievable. What?
- I can't believe it.

348
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,150
- We got the wrong night?
- Yeah, you did.

349
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,550
- Oh, shoot. All right.
- Jesus Christ. Holy cow.

350
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:22,350
I'm actually glad
to hear this.

351
00:16:22,384 --> 00:16:24,751
I was a little pissed off
that you didn't call.

352
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,916
- Oh, well, now you know why we didn't call.
- Yeah.

353
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:30,117
- Hey, Mary.
- Of course we didn't call... 'Cause we were coming tonight.

354
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:32,117
- Come on in.
- Oh, no no. We're not gonna come in.

355
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:35,550
- Yeah, come in, seriously.
- We got the wrong night. It's our fault.

356
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:38,384
- Hey, Mary.
- They thought the party was tonight.

357
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:40,651
You're kidding.

358
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,651
Can you believe
how stupid we are?

359
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,484
- All right, it's good to see you.
- Larr.

360
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,751
- We'll call you later.
- No way you're leaving.

361
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,983
This is fantastic. We
have so much leftover food.

362
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,550
You're gonna come in
and help us eat it.

363
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,651
I'll call you tomorrow
and we'll get together.

364
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:54,651
- We'll do the whole...
- Why?

365
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:56,751
- We'll do a proper...
- I'll take you out to dinner. I'm paying.

366
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,417
Hey, larr, you don't have any plans,

367
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,284
You're supposed to be here, you're here.

368
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,117
Come on in. Come in,
Cheryl. It'll be fun.

369
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:09,684
Well...

370
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:11,916
This'll be fun. We've got
leftovers. We'll make an omelet.

371
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,684
- Sure. Oh yeah.
- You guys, we can't... We can't...

372
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,317
It'll be great.
Come on.

373
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,384
This is like pulling teeth.

374
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:21,484
Come on in,
you guys.

375
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,983
I don't know.
Can you still see it?

376
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,850
- Not like it was.
- A huge cyst.

377
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,717
It was like... When they
got around to taking it out,

378
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:37,050
It turns out I could
have almost broken my jaw

379
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,050
- By just chewing on ice.
- Oh my gosh.

380
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,217
- It got all the way down into here.
- But the dentist

381
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:44,850
Really undersold the
magnitude of it, I think.

382
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,117
- Oh, completely.
- 'Cause you thought it would be nothing.

383
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:49,950
- Ever had any operations
like that? - No, huh-Uh.

384
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:56,017
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

385
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,017
So what's going on
with you guys?

386
00:17:58,117 --> 00:18:01,217
- Eh, not much, not much.
- Nothing.

387
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:03,317
You know something?
You're behaving like

388
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,317
- You don't want to be here, Larry.
- No.

389
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,050
- What?
- You want to be here, don't you, larr?

390
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,250
Absolutely. That's crazy.
Of course I want to be here.

391
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:12,417
- I just feel I'm intruding, that's all.
- We are intruding.

392
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:14,050
I was raised not to intrude on people.

393
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,384
My mother would be horrified...
horrified if she knew

394
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:19,384
That I was sitting
in the living room

395
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:21,584
The night after a big
party just took place...

396
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,950
Horrified.
And it's bothering me.

397
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,217
Oh my God,
you know what?

398
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:28,484
I left the car
running.

399
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:31,117
- No, you didn't.
- How did you know I didn't?

400
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:33,217
If you walk away from the
car, it's on, and you got

401
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:35,217
Your car keys in your hand, it
goes "beep beep beep beep beep."

402
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:37,250
No, it doesn't go "beep
beep beep beep beep."

403
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,883
Yeah, it does go "beep
beep beep beep beep," Larry.

404
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:40,417
- I have one too.
- Really?

405
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:42,417
- Do you want to make a little side bet?
- Yeah.

406
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:43,983
- How much?
- 500 bucks.

407
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,250
- Okay, 500 bucks?
- Yeah.

408
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,217
- Okay, yeah, you're on.
- All right, great.

409
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:48,617
Okay, I'm gonna go
check the car.

410
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,217
You check the car.
You stay where you are.

411
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:51,950
- She can do anything she wants.
- No no.

412
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:57,584
I'll get it.
This is ridiculous.

413
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,384
Teddy, we're late. We're
sorry. You know cha cha, right?

414
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:07,850
- I do. Hi, cha cha. Nice to see you.
- Hi.

415
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,484
What's with the
no-Valet for the party?

416
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:10,617
You need some dough?

417
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,150
Yeah, see,
you made a mistake.

418
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,150
You think that the party
is tonight,

419
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,150
But it was actually
last night.

420
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,783
- You're kidding, right? It's a joke?
- No, I'm not.

421
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:21,417
- So come on in and sit.
- No, it's...

422
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:23,484
- it's embarrassing.
- No no, it's not embarrassing.

423
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:26,517
You know, Larry and Cheryl made
the exact same mistake you did.

424
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:28,450
- Come on in.
- Hi.

425
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:30,850
- Mary, Cheryl.
- You won't believe this:

426
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,850
They made the exact same
mistake you did, Larry.

427
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,250
They thought the party
was tonight. Interesting.

428
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,684
Yeah, it is
interesting.

429
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,850
Can I get you guys a drink?
You want a drink, Richard?

430
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,783
Uh, I'm a recovering
alcoholic.

431
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:44,017
Oh, right. I forgot
that. He's an alcoholic.

432
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,783
- Okay, you want something?
- Hi, Cheryl, Mary.

433
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:48,916
- Remember cha cha?
- Can I talk to you for a second?

434
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:50,317
- Hey, cha cha.
- What are you doing?

435
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:51,883
What did you steal
my thing for?

436
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,883
- What thing? -
Showing-Up-On-The-Wrong- Night thing.

437
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,150
What, do you have a fucking
copyright on this stupid little thing?

438
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,883
You're making a fool out
of me. He's onto me now.

439
00:19:57,983 --> 00:19:59,983
You think you're making a
fool of... I'm being made a...

440
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,717
I got 35 calls.

441
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,850
Don't ever say to anyone you
want to have sex with my girlf...

442
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,850
I didn't say... We were
playing "the newlywed game."

443
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:07,717
What does that have to do with "I
want to have intercourse with cha cha"?

444
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,250
I wanted to win the game. Do you
even know what I'm talking about?

445
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,250
Okay, you know what?

446
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,584
I can't stay in the same house
as him. We're gonna go. Come on.

447
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:16,450
No no no, you know what? I should go.

448
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,484
- No no no, I'm going.
- No no, I'm going.

449
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,550
- No no!
- No no, I don't think you understand.

450
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:22,384
- I have to go.
- No, I'm going. You stay.

451
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:23,850
- No, you stay.
- You stay.

452
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,484
- You stay. You stay.
- You stay. You stay.

453
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:28,017
- Ted.
- Sorry. Thank you for everything.

454
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:30,017
- So lovely.
- Bye-Bye.

455
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:31,916
Good night.

456
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,450
Come on, schmohawk!

457
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,050
Oh, Larry.

458
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,017
Uh... Hey.

459
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:03,684
Oh, gosh.

460
00:21:03,816 --> 00:21:05,584
Look at them.

461
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:07,916
Hi.

462
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,384
Are you waiting for the
Davids by any chance?

463
00:21:10,484 --> 00:21:12,017
- Yes.
- You are?

464
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:14,017
- Wake up, baby. Wake up, auntie Rae.
- Oh my goodness.

465
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:16,584
- We're so sorry we're late, so sorry.
- Things happen, they do.

466
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,384
Well, you know,
traffic...

467
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:20,284
You'll see, in Los
Angeles it's terrible.

468
00:21:20,384 --> 00:21:22,717
- I'm Loretta black.
- Hi. Larry.

469
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,150
Cheryl.

470
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,217
- This is my auntie Rae.
- Hello, I'm Larry.

471
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:28,684
- These are my kids, Keysha and daryl.
- Keysha and daryl.

472
00:21:28,783 --> 00:21:31,217
So let me see, your last name is black?

473
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:32,584
- Yes.
- Mm-Hmm.

474
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:35,916
It's like if my
last name was Jew,

475
00:21:36,017 --> 00:21:38,017
Like Larry Jew...

476
00:21:39,017 --> 00:21:40,916
'Cause I'm Jewish.

477
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:43,850
Well, we really do appreciate
y'all letting us stay with you.

478
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:46,317
- We really do. We appreciate it.
- We really do.

479
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:48,816
- No, I was just saying, 'cause you're black...
- Larry, grab...

480
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,684
- it's not too heavy for you, is it?
- No no.

481
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:53,484
- Get that...
- And I'm Jewish.

482
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:55,950
Thank you so much. We
really do appreciate it.

483
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:57,983
- It's not too heavy for you, is it, Larry?
- No.

484
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,517
Thank you,
thank you.

485
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:02,684
Okay, say your last name
was gentile...

486
00:22:02,783 --> 00:22:05,751
- come on in.
- Ooh, would you look at that?

487
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,883
- This is nice.
- This is real nice.

488
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,584
Oh, yes.
My goodness.

489
00:22:11,684 --> 00:22:14,484
And spacious too.
I mean, just...

490
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,150
What do you think, huh? Isn't
it something? You like it?

491
00:22:17,284 --> 00:22:19,250
It's a swank place you got
here, Larry, very swank.

492
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:20,783
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Oh, auntie Rae.

493
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,751
Go go, you go
take a look around.

494
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,317
- Go ahead.
- Oh, thank you. Go on, babies.

495
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:27,484
- Don't touch anything.
- Yeah, I thank you, I thank you.

496
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,850
Mm mm! This is
a nice place.

497
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,083
Fixtures going
all along the staircase...

498
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:38,517
Ooh-Ee!
I can't believe this.

499
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:41,250
- We don't smoke in the house.
- Them curtains... Just fabulous.

500
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:44,584
- And the couches... They so fluffy!
- Cigarette... Smoking...

501
00:22:44,684 --> 00:22:46,384
- y'all got nice taste.
- Thank you.

502
00:22:46,484 --> 00:22:48,050
- Where's the kitchen at?
- It's right around there.

503
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,417
I'm going. I'm going.

504
00:22:50,517 --> 00:22:52,150
- This is so great.
- She's smoking.

505
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,150
They're so great.

506
00:22:54,217 --> 00:22:56,117
Oh, you know what we should
do? Let's have a party.

507
00:22:56,217 --> 00:22:58,584
Let's have a party and invite our
friends so they can meet the blacks.

508
00:22:58,684 --> 00:23:00,317
- A party?
- Hey, you guys want to have a party?

509
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:02,183
Yeah, Loretta?

510
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,350
What?
A party?

511
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,083
- We're having a big party.
- Uh-Huh. You need a cake?

512
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:17,250
We do. A chocolate layered cake.

513
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,117
We want to get
the same one

514
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,183
That Marty Funkhouser
gets.

515
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,816
Oh, yes. He's actually
ordered it a couple of times.

516
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,350
- Yeah.
- I have one

517
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,384
That I just
prepared recently.

518
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,183
I think it was the best
cake we've ever had.

519
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:31,017
- Unbelievable.
- We can't stop talking about it.

520
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,083
It is one of our
most popular cakes.

521
00:23:33,183 --> 00:23:37,284
- I can understand why.
- Yes, and here he is.

522
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,550
- That's a penis.
- Yeah, well, we're an erotic bakery.

523
00:23:50,017 --> 00:23:52,651
Oh my God.

524
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:55,450
This is where Marty
buys his cakes?

525
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,183
- I ate that?
- Yes, you ate this cake.

526
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,550
Funkhouser... He
knowingly served us penis.

527
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:04,183
- What is wrong with that guy?
- Let's go.

528
00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:05,816
- What an idiot.
- Thank you. This is crazy...

529
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,017
- a crotch.
- The cake is delicious, by the way.

530
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,584
Thank you
very much, sir.

531
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,950
- I'll tell you, it was something else.
- She's right.

532
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:18,050
It was one of the scariest things
I've ever experienced in my lifetime.

533
00:24:18,117 --> 00:24:20,950
- We are lucky we got out of there alive.
- Yes, we are.

534
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,850
- I want you to meet these guys.
- Okay.

535
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,916
I hope we're not too
rude, but we showed up

536
00:24:25,017 --> 00:24:27,717
- The night of the party.
- Good one.

537
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:29,017
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

538
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:31,017
Let me ask you
a question.

539
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:32,916
How come you didn't
tell me that I was eating

540
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,384
- A black penis the other night?
- You mean the cake?

541
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:36,916
Yeah.

542
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,117
Well, I told you
it was a black log cake.

543
00:24:39,183 --> 00:24:41,117
Yeah, still,

544
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:44,217
I was eating a black penis.
You didn't mention it.

545
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:48,017
Well, eating a black penis is
not appetizing to everybody.

546
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:49,950
Next time you're gonna
do something like that,

547
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,417
Tell me, okay?
I think that's unfair.

548
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,850
Why did you take
the balls home?

549
00:24:53,017 --> 00:24:55,217
I didn't know
they were balls.

550
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:04,017
Excuse me.

551
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:07,484
Mm-Hmm.
Yes, it was you.

552
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,083
Well... Oh, boy oh boy. Hey.

553
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:11,651
- Hi.
- Hi, cha cha.

554
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:14,850
- Hi, Larry.
- I'm sorry about the other night.

555
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:17,317
I was just trying to win
"the newlywed game" is all.

556
00:25:17,484 --> 00:25:19,150
Look, I'm over it.
I'm here.

557
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,751
- Believe me, I'm way over it.
- You know...

558
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,484
- hey, everybody, who wants cake?
- I do, I do.

559
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:26,584
Oh, great great. The best
cake I ever had. Come on.

560
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:28,217
...Give you
a childish apology...

561
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:30,050
No, because it was
my routine and...

562
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:35,484
Jeff!

563
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:38,550
Jeff, the cake!
Jeff!

564
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:10,150
I'm...

565
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:12,417
I'm so sorry.
First of all,

566
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,916
You have to understand
something, okay?

567
00:26:15,017 --> 00:26:17,484
My friend Jeff
did not know...

568
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:20,950
Did not know that there
was a penis in that box

569
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,950
When he picked that up
from the bakery.

570
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,150
He called in the order
and they gave him the box.

571
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,250
He didn't look
inside the box.

572
00:26:29,517 --> 00:26:31,651
How's Keysha?

573
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:35,651
I finally got her to sleep. She's upset.

574
00:26:35,783 --> 00:26:37,717
Of course.
Of course she's upset.

575
00:26:37,816 --> 00:26:40,083
Understandable. To see
a big penis like that...

576
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:42,983
What are you gonna do?
She's a little girl.

577
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:47,816
Okay, you know...

578
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,816
The smoking-In-The-House

579
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:52,317
I wanted to talk
to you about.

580
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:54,983
Um, is there any way

581
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:57,017
Maybe you would
consider

582
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:00,017
Smoking...

583
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:02,450
Outside

584
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,450
On occasion?

585
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,083
How's the cake?

586
00:27:07,183 --> 00:27:09,751
- Pretty good.
- Mmm.

587
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:12,284
Pretty... Pretty good.

588
00:27:12,384 --> 00:27:14,384
You want some?

589
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:20,816
Good night.

590
00:27:22,284 --> 00:27:24,284
Good night.

591
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:43,183
- Where have you been?
- Ate some penis.

592
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,384
So what are we
gonna do now, l.D.?

593
00:28:18,484 --> 00:28:21,217
Maybe some family will adopt us.

594
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:23,017
Holy moly.

595
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:25,783
What happened?

596
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:29,117
- A fire.
- Oh my God.

597
00:28:31,284 --> 00:28:33,183
What are you
doing here?

598
00:28:33,284 --> 00:28:35,816
- Oh, I'm here for the party.
- The party?

599
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:38,651
The party was
yesterday.

600
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,484
What?

601
00:28:40,584 --> 00:28:42,783
Yesterday.
The party was yesterday.

602
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:44,484
OH, YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
