1
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,689
My... this is really
coming along here.

2
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:25,004
Hey, I'll take
a Seven and Seven.

3
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,833
- What are you doing?
- A little plumbing.

4
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,571
A little plumbing.
Got to plumb.

5
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:33,306
Plumb the depths...

6
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:36,783
the depths of hell.

7
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:40,476
What is this thing,
marble, this bar?

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,578
Yeah.

9
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:43,782
Ever schlep marble?

10
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:48,988
You ought to try
schlepping marble one day.

11
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:51,725
It's a schlep.

12
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:57,228
Okay, so you just
sign these two, okay?

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,532
- Lou-man.
- How are you?

14
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:00,039
Good, how are you doing?

15
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:02,064
I gotta talk to the meat guy,
see you guys later.

16
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,168
Larry, hey, I am
so glad you came in.

17
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:06,771
Hello, Hugh.

18
00:01:06,813 --> 00:01:09,281
I have invited everybody...
all the other investors,

19
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:11,307
over to my house
for a pool party,

20
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:14,411
and I had hoped to invite you
and here you are.

21
00:01:14,454 --> 00:01:16,888
- Everybody's going?
- Yep, yeah.

22
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:18,413
- Terrific.
- And now you.

23
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,789
All right, all right.

24
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:22,420
Well, that's terrific.
Hopefully see you Sunday.

25
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:26,558
Hey, Hugh...
that sounds funny.

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,036
Didn't you tell me that you're the head
of Mellon-Ritter Publishing?

27
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,130
And you do "Bartlett's
Quotations," right?

28
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:35,767
That is the flagship
of our fleet, yeah.

29
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:37,868
Okay, 'cause my friend,
Richard Lewis,

30
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:39,572
wants to get into
"Bartlett's Quotations."

31
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:41,240
He has a quotable quote?

32
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:43,442
He coined the phrase,
"The blank from hell."

33
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:45,508
- That's his?
- Absolutely.

34
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:47,076
It's been around
for some time.

35
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,554
No, that's his.
"The blank from hell," yeah.

36
00:01:49,589 --> 00:01:52,683
You know, like,
the "woman from hell" or...

37
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:55,524
- The "mother-in-law from hell," yeah.
- Yeah, whatever.

38
00:01:55,562 --> 00:02:00,226
Yeah, I will, I'll run this by
my partner..."The blank from hell."

39
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:02,565
- Yeah.
- Look forward to seeing you Sunday.

40
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:04,001
Okay.

41
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:05,868
Hey. How are you?

42
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:08,670
- Good.
- So what's going on, man?

43
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:12,007
- You going to his pool party?
- Yeah, I am, yeah, I am.

44
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,842
Wearing a bathing suit?
You going swimming?

45
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,905
- Speedo. Speedo.
- Speedo?

46
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:19,385
Yeah. Listen, I am bringing
somebody there.

47
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:22,513
- Good for you.
- Yeah, Susie.

48
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:26,356
- Ah...!
- Yeah, yeah, I know...

49
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:27,724
Uh-huh.

50
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:30,229
Keep this under wraps,
'cause this is...

51
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:33,721
I shouldn't say anything
'cause this is not...

52
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,702
you can tell Cheryl.
That's it, okay?

53
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:39,500
Susie's pregnant.

54
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:42,007
Yeah, so I'm moving back in.

55
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,873
I get to move back
into my house, if...

56
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,844
the only thing that stinks
is that stupid dog

57
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,780
that I'm allergic to.
Other than that I'm very happy.

58
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:52,080
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, it's all good. It's very good.

59
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:54,609
Oh, yeah,
it sounds great.

60
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:56,918
No, it is, it's really good.
It's good, trust me.

61
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:59,152
It'll all be fine.

62
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:03,856
Well, all right, welcome back
to the married people's club.

63
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:05,296
Oh, we're all so happy.

64
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:08,495
I was saying to my wife,
"You should let me date,

65
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:11,629
because it'll bring us much closer.
I'll come home,

66
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:13,832
we'll talk about the date.
You'll say, 'How did the date go? '

67
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:16,934
I'll say, 'Oh, I couldn't stand her,
she did this and that"'...

68
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:18,376
the way you talk
to a guy about it.

69
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:20,276
So we'd have a good laugh
and then we'd have sex

70
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:22,975
- and we'd have a good time.
- You and your wife would have sex?

71
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:24,677
Yeah, after I told her about my date.

72
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:27,312
But what if you ended up
getting laid from the date?

73
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:30,949
I'd tell her about that too.
"We went back to her place,

74
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:34,256
we had sex and I had to make up
an excuse to leave and whatever."

75
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,530
That's beautiful.
I like that.

76
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:38,929
- Perfect world.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,099
Hey, look at this.

78
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:46,196
- Aw-ww.
- "Going out of business."

79
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,232
Where are we gonna buy our bread?
Our favorite bakery.

80
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:52,939
What's going on? You guys
are going out of business?

81
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:55,948
- Yep, we just lost the lease.
- Oh, what a shame.

82
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:58,109
- I know, it's horrible.
- Oh, too bad.

83
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:01,348
We got here just in time,
didn't we?

84
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:03,356
We're still in business.
We're thriving.

85
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,551
Great.

86
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:08,493
All right, well, we need something
for our little pool party.

87
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:11,497
Yeah, we need
probably a cake, right?

88
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:14,466
Mmm-hmm,
sponge-cake.

89
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,264
Wait, wait, wait,
are you kidding me?

90
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:18,294
Nobody's gonna eat that.

91
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:20,101
This is the best
sponge-cake in town.

92
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,573
I know what I'm talking about.

93
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:23,303
It's so moist,
it's like eating a sponge.

94
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:26,176
Okay, listen,
why don't we...

95
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:28,476
why don't we go with this one?
It looks better and it's...

96
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:30,949
We'll get... trust me
on this one, okay?

97
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,815
The sponge-cake.
Yeah, we'll take that.

98
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:34,820
We'll take it,
but no one's gonna eat it.

99
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:37,414
- How much is that?
- This is $12.95.

100
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:40,585
- What?
- $12.95.

101
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,925
No wonder you're
going out of business.

102
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,706
He's got some place here,
Mellon, huh?

103
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:59,007
You know, it's a little
ostentatious.

104
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:01,741
- Oh, Jeffrey.
- This is so good.

105
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:04,341
- Unbelievable.
- Thank you.

106
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:06,284
It's like eating
a delicious sponge.

107
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,720
"It's like eating a delicious sponge."
Did I tell you?

108
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:13,192
I haven't seen sponge-cake since
my grandmother's mah jong game.

109
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:15,626
That doesn't mean
it's not good.

110
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:18,631
- Where'd you get it?
- They're going out of business.

111
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:20,257
But where, tell me?

112
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,632
It's moot, they're going
out of business.

113
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,933
- That's not moot.
- How's that not moot?

114
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:26,438
- It's not moot.
- It is moot.

115
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:28,668
They're going out
of business, Jeff.

116
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,404
What do you
need to know?

117
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:34,413
- It's not a moot point.
- All right, it's Butterman's.

118
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:36,677
That's a good bakery.
They're going out of business?

119
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:39,651
- Yeah.
- That's a shame, those poor people.

120
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:41,551
Maybe they're retiring.

121
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,954
I don't know. Anyway,
where's the bathroom?

122
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,357
You have to use the cabana.
They won't let you in the house.

123
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:48,861
What?

124
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,590
No, they won't
let you in the house.

125
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,598
They want people
to use the cabana bathroom.

126
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,759
- Come on.
- He's special.

127
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:57,326
He thinks the rules
don't apply to him.

128
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,361
- This is unbelievable sponge-cake.
- Jeff.

129
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,670
Hi, you having
a good time?

130
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,939
Oh, yeah, I just need
to use the bathroom.

131
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:07,139
The cabana across
from the pool,

132
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,045
they have
the restroom in there.

133
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,174
Can't I go in here?

134
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:13,185
Sorry, I can't.
Outside sandbox only.

135
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:15,483
Straight over there.
There's plenty of toilet paper.

136
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:18,047
Why can't I go?
I'm not wet or anything.

137
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,218
I'm not gonna dirty the house.
I'll wipe my feet.

138
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,091
I'd love to make a concession...

139
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:24,096
- An exception?
- An exception. But I can't,

140
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,325
'cause I'll get in trouble
by Mr. Mellon, so...

141
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:29,858
I know Mr. Mellon.
I wouldn't worry about it, okay?

142
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:33,430
- You know Hugh?
- I know Hugh and it's no problem.

143
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:35,100
- I'll get in trouble.
- You won't.

144
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:36,904
I'll take care of the whole thing.
I really have to go.

145
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:39,935
- I don't want any trouble.
- There's no trouble, don't worry.

146
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:42,948
It'll take two seconds.
This is fine. This is silly.

147
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,279
It's just a bathroom.

148
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:46,080
You're gonna go
number one, right?

149
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:48,644
- Yes. I'll be done in two seconds.
- Just number one!

150
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:54,084
- Larry.
- Hugh.

151
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:56,595
- Tell me you're enjoying yourself.
- No!

152
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:58,688
Glad you could make it.

153
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:00,529
Larry, how did you
get into the bathroom?

154
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:03,832
I sweet-talked
my way in there.

155
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,931
Nobody can turn down
the David charm once I turn it on.

156
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:10,374
Do you know what I'd do if I had
to go? Sprint and run her over.

157
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,208
Meanwhile, have you seen anybody
from the restaurant here?

158
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:14,508
Nope, nope, only us.

159
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:17,448
Ted Danson's not here?
What about Michael York?

160
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:19,679
No, we're the only idiots
to accept these invitations.

161
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:21,311
- Yeah.
- Right?

162
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:23,879
Nobody from the restaurant?
I can't even believe it.

163
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:26,915
- Why did we have to come?
- We came, we're good this way.

164
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,689
"Oh, hello, Johnny."

165
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:30,389
What?

166
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,421
Look what's going on
with this kid.

167
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:36,361
Wow.

168
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:38,131
Honestly, it's huge.

169
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:40,366
It's bigger than mine.
He's got a bigger penis than me.

170
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:42,271
Isn't that Hugh's kid?

171
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:44,674
Oy vey is mir.

172
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:46,804
Let's just go.
Let's just go.

173
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:50,577
- Go? It's circus freak show.
- Circus freak show.

174
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:53,142
You know what?
Cheryl's right, let's go.

175
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:54,653
It's like a freak show...

176
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:56,678
We got a freak show here.
Where are you going?

177
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:58,190
Please, it's not funny.

178
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:05,897
Gee.

179
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:08,696
That's it right there.

180
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:12,537
All right.

181
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:18,203
This is unbelievable.

182
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:19,506
What?

183
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:22,606
They stuff you in
like sardines here.

184
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:25,049
The guy deserves
to make a living.

185
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:27,552
This is gonna be a great lunch.
Look at this.

186
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:29,680
Relax, man, just relax.

187
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:31,849
I can't even talk.
You can't say anything.

188
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:33,950
Direct it right to me.

189
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,756
It's like having
a "whisper lunch."

190
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:39,026
- It's a whisper lunch.
- Like the Mafia thing.

191
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:41,192
I have a dental appointment
tomorrow at 3:00.

192
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,804
Hey, I spoke
to the Hugh Mellon guy.

193
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,105
- You spoke with him?
- I spoke to him about your quote,

194
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:52,668
"The blank from hell."

195
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:57,280
And he's interested.
He'll talk to his partner.

196
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:58,306
- Really?
- Yeah.

197
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:00,683
You might get
into Bartlett's.

198
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,745
Number one,
this lunch is on me.

199
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:05,849
It's about time I get
credit for this thing.

200
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,587
- Absolutely.
- But the right way.

201
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,618
So he's, he actually...

202
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:15,928
He's positive?
Does he feel good that it's me?

203
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:19,700
He actually...
knew of the quote,

204
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:23,436
but he didn't really attribute it
to you. He just thought it was...

205
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,444
He didn't attribute it to me?

206
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:28,208
That really pisses me off
that I don't get credit for that.

207
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,079
Absolutely,
I don't blame you.

208
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:33,415
And at the pool party
I told him about your special.

209
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:35,751
Right.

210
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:39,349
And I invited him to the HBO
screening tomorrow night.

211
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:43,328
So he's gonna come
if it's okay with you.

212
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:45,627
Yeah, I'll be able
to milk him a little bit.

213
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:47,895
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

214
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:53,100
No, that's cool.

215
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:55,107
Have you been
getting all this?

216
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:58,599
- Been getting all this?
- I'm eating my lunch.

217
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:03,310
This is the lunch from hell.

218
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,112
What did you say?

219
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:08,018
I'm saying, this is
the lunch from hell.

220
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:10,181
Where'd you hear
that expression?

221
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:14,159
- Girlfriend?
- You see what I mean?

222
00:10:14,193 --> 00:10:16,252
This kills me.

223
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,727
Okay, guys, so what
happened at Alsace?

224
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,863
Alsace, s'il vous plaît.

225
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:30,433
- "Alsace," whatever.
- He doesn't want to work with us.

226
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:32,410
I saw that.

227
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:34,913
What did you see?

228
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,781
I had a little problem with
this woman and her husband

229
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:39,216
who kind of came
after me and...

230
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:41,880
What about Ted's guy?
What about Josh?

231
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:44,890
Josh cooked a beautiful meal,
but Larry didn't like it.

232
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:47,358
It was a little saucy,
a little saucy.

233
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:49,384
- We have no chef?
- No chef.

234
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:55,365
- How long?
- We open in two weeks.

235
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:59,337
We basically stopped looking
after we got Randy.

236
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:02,830
So we're back to square one.

237
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,038
You got arms on your chair?

238
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,070
You've got arms on your chair.
Look at that.

239
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:09,911
- What?
- One second.

240
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:12,611
- I got no arms, what is that?
- What are you doing?

241
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:15,416
I'm just getting
a chair with arms.

242
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:17,753
Larry, what are you doing?
You want to focus?

243
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,951
We're in this mess
'cause you took our chef

244
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:21,927
for your own
little personal party.

245
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,895
At least I was at
the pool party yesterday.

246
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,023
I'm trying to be
part of this thing.

247
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:28,329
- The what?
- I had a pool party yesterday.

248
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:31,235
Jeff and I were the only ones
who showed up.

249
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,170
It was a little
embarrassing, yeah.

250
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:35,538
I think you all
owe him an apology.

251
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:38,738
I told you I couldn't make it.
I'm glad you had a good time.

252
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:41,144
Hugh, I'm sorry,
I wrote the wrong date in my book.

253
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,875
I was tied up
at the last minute.

254
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:45,406
We have no chef.

255
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:47,146
It was a good party.
We had a great time.

256
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:49,017
Thank you for coming.

257
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:51,990
Enough about parties,
what about chefs?

258
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:54,050
We need to take responsibility
for getting a chef.

259
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:58,223
Absolutely. Make a concerted
effort together, please.

260
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:01,358
When I need a new editor
I get him, beg, borrow or steal.

261
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:03,699
I go out, raid, get...
we need to do that with a chef.

262
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:06,227
I was in this restaurant the other day,
it was a coffee shop.

263
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:09,708
And for some reason
I had a side dish of applesauce.

264
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:13,143
I have to tell you
it was really fantastic.

265
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:15,272
It was so tasty.
And I'm thinking

266
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:17,748
they never serve
applesauce in restaurants

267
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:19,684
and it could really be...

268
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,346
if and when
the time comes for us

269
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:24,083
to be thinking about stuff
like this as a side dish.

270
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:26,489
We're gonna write that down.
Very helpful.

271
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,187
When you look for your chef,

272
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:29,854
Make sure they know
a little about applesauce.

273
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,830
You buy it at a supermarket.
It comes in a jar.

274
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:36,358
We should consider it for the menu.
Encourage people even.

275
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:38,370
I think we're good,
I got to go to a meeting.

276
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:40,133
Everybody's
gonna look, right?

277
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:41,765
If anyone finds
anything out, call.

278
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:43,969
It's a very underrated side dish,
that's my point.

279
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,877
It's an underrated side dish.

280
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:48,813
Did you really just sign
Sarah Jessica Parker

281
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:50,748
to a recording contract?

282
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:53,081
Yeah, why not?

283
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:57,320
I want to show solidarity,
but otherwise...

284
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,256
It's gonna work out.
Don't worry about it.

285
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,658
It's only money.
Big deal.

286
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:03,662
Yeah, my money, Larry.
See you later.

287
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:05,755
- Excellent.
- Love to meet with you, Hugh.

288
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:07,789
- Bye bye.
- All right.

289
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:08,960
Thank you
so much for coming.

290
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:11,333
Oh, please, we had
a wonderful time.

291
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,837
It's too bad these other
schlubs couldn't...

292
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:15,067
- They missed a good party.
- Yeah, they sure did.

293
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:17,042
The weather worked out,
it was great.

294
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:19,374
It was a little rude
on their part, I thought.

295
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:21,209
I don't care.

296
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:24,944
So at the pool yesterday,
I saw your son.

297
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:28,010
The kid's got some penis on him.
He's pretty good.

298
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:30,215
What are you saying?

299
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:32,781
Your son, his penis.

300
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:34,816
What are you saying
that to me for?

301
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:38,820
Hey, it's a compliment.
What's the big deal?

302
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:40,924
What's the "compliment"?

303
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:44,130
How is it bad? He's got a nice,
big penis, so what?

304
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,832
I'm not talking about
your wife's tits. This is rude.

305
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:50,036
You could say my wife has nice tits
as long as it's complimentary.

306
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:53,235
Come on, Hugh.

307
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,680
Hugh, not "you,"
Hugh, okay?

308
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:00,786
H-yoo...

309
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,220
Hugh.

310
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:08,919
I'm sorry you're having
such a hard time.

311
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:11,897
- Hi.
- Hi.

312
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:14,695
Hi.

313
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:17,703
Hi.

314
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:21,036
You remember Martine,
the Mellons' nanny?

315
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:23,041
From the pool party.

316
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:25,873
Yeah, she's having
a bit of a problem.

317
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:29,746
A problem, I'll say.
Mr. Mellon fired me.

318
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:33,843
It's my suitcase,
it doesn't have wheels.

319
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:36,081
Oh.

320
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:38,022
So she came over here.

321
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:40,753
It seems that one
of the guests

322
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:43,921
felt the cabana bathroom
was beneath him

323
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:47,262
and made his way
into the main house.

324
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,667
How did he find out?

325
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:53,171
Margarita the cook.

326
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:55,504
She's got a problem with me.

327
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:59,602
She told that I was the person
that let the guest in.

328
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,738
- She squealed on you?
- She ratted!

329
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:04,477
- And he fired you?
- And he fired me.

330
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,951
Of course I remember
what you said about, you know,

331
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:09,682
you would be responsible
if anything happened.

332
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:12,088
Did you tell him
that it was me?

333
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:15,924
No, I don't "dime,"
I didn't dime.

334
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:18,692
So I remember
when I let you in,

335
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,666
you said, "If there's
any problem," I think,

336
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:25,102
"I'll take care of it."
So here I am.

337
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:27,367
I'm gonna have
to hold you to that

338
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,670
'cause I don't
have another job.

339
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,377
So I am homeless.

340
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:38,315
- Except I don't stink.
- Okay.

341
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:42,185
Your home is big.

342
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:44,781
You know what,
Martine? I bet...

343
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:46,951
Mr. David can do something
about this situation.

344
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,188
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

345
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:52,220
Is there any way that you could
maybe talk to Mr. Mellon

346
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,358
and straighten things out?
Because I think

347
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,198
if you spoke with him,
I don't know...

348
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:00,399
he would take me back.
I'm a pretty good nanny.

349
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,407
- All right.
- I brought my suitcase

350
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:05,171
so if there's any problem,
I can just stay here.

351
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:06,610
There won't be a problem.

352
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:09,672
- Larry will take care of it.
- Oh, I hope so.

353
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:11,876
Ahem... well...

354
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:16,584
that's a really good idea
and ordinarily I would,

355
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:19,853
but Hugh and I have had
kind of a falling-out.

356
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:21,883
What happened?

357
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:25,488
Well, I was in
the restaurant earlier and...

358
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:30,728
we got to talking
about the party.

359
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,069
I happened to mention that I caught
a glimpse of his son's penis and...

360
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:36,472
How about that thing?

361
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:39,501
It's huge!

362
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:42,036
- It was the wrong thing to do.
- It probably was.

363
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:46,040
Anyway, like I was saying,
it's gonna be difficult...

364
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,488
to talk to him.

365
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:51,990
Why would you
do that, Larry?

366
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:53,958
I took a risk.

367
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:58,888
You know what?
I think you won't have a problem

368
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:01,832
finding another job.

369
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,700
People in this town
love nannies.

370
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:06,762
- They need them.
- Yeah.

371
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:10,003
I'll need Mr. Mellon as a reference
if I get another nanny job.

372
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:12,909
He was my only reference,
that was my first nanny job.

373
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:15,573
- Oh.
- What did you do before that?

374
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:17,582
Before that, I worked
at Magic Mountain

375
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:20,050
in the "Looney Tunes" Lodge
for 15 years.

376
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:23,146
It's where the "Looney Tunes"
characters would come out

377
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,123
and sign autographs for kids.

378
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:27,523
You know, Jeff and I

379
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,085
went there once
with his daughter.

380
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:32,597
- You did?
- I went in there.

381
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:35,099
And that song,
that theme is played...

382
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:43,968
- They play it all the time.
- It was fun.

383
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:46,978
Can I talk to you in the kitchen
for just a second?

384
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:48,912
Sure.

385
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:51,917
I told you not to use
that bathroom.

386
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:53,782
Why did she
come over here?

387
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:56,151
Obviously she thinks
I'm responsible

388
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:58,315
for getting her fired
and has no place to go.

389
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:00,757
She brought her suitcase,
did you see that?

390
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:02,658
- I saw it.
- She thinks she's staying here?

391
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:04,492
I don't know what she thinks.

392
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,395
I don't want the nanny
from hell in my house.

393
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:09,560
Where did you hear that...
"the blank from hell"?

394
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:10,728
That expression?

395
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,260
My dad used to say it
all the time.

396
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:14,169
You know, everything
was "from hell."

397
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:17,471
- No, see, that's Richard Lewis'.
- It's not Richard Lewis'.

398
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,171
My dad has been saying that...

399
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:21,042
Richard Lewis
coined that, Cheryl.

400
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,277
The point is, I do not
want her here, okay?

401
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:26,807
You wouldn't believe
what she's been telling me

402
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:29,821
for the last 20 minutes.
She's full of non-sequiturs.

403
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:32,323
She tells me
she likes to pet horses.

404
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:34,326
She enjoys
a good corn dog.

405
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,225
Enjoys a good corn dog?

406
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:38,093
She takes baths
with her socks on.

407
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,258
Honestly, she's got a screw
loose somewhere.

408
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,030
She's maybe a little eccentric,
but she seems harmless.

409
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:55,345
Wait a second.

410
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,612
Jeff needs a nanny.

411
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:03,417
Susie's pregnant.
Their nanny just left.

412
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:05,788
- Susie's pregnant?
- I haven't told you.

413
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,816
She's pregnant.
That's why he moved back.

414
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,885
But they're looking
for a nanny.

415
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:12,796
- You're not gonna suggest her?
- Well, why not?

416
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:14,094
You know nothing about her.

417
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,361
She was a good nanny.

418
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:17,130
She didn't get fired
for being a bad nanny.

419
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:19,501
She got fired for letting me
use the bathroom.

420
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,304
If they don't like her,
they don't have to use her.

421
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:24,934
Right, they could meet her and...

422
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:27,241
We're doing them a favor.

423
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,112
This is a win-win
situation. Win-win.

424
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,626
You know, we gotta stop off
and get some sponge-cake.

425
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:52,535
- Okay.
- It's my friend's birthday.

426
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:54,505
- I'll buy him sponge-cake.
- There you go.

427
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,100
- You like sponge-cake?
- Who doesn't?

428
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:59,133
How many sponge-cakes
do you have left?

429
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:01,669
I have a dozen left.

430
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:03,682
- A dozen?
- Yeah.

431
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:06,810
Okay... I'll take them all.

432
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:08,444
- Okay. All of them?
- Yeah.

433
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:10,182
I don't have
any more boxes.

434
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:14,352
That's okay. Put them
in Saran Wrap or something.

435
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:16,293
- I can do that.
- Okay, great.

436
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:18,421
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

437
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,360
Hey!

438
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,304
What are you doing?

439
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,965
Take it easy.
They're free.

440
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:49,258
- Here, get the bell.
- I got my hands full too.

441
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:51,729
Look at me.

442
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:08,203
- Hello.
- Hi!

443
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,613
This is Martine, the nanny
I was telling you about.

444
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:12,810
Hi, Martine,
I'm Susie Greene.

445
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,284
What the fuck is this?
What are these?

446
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,221
- Oh, sponge-cakes.
- What do you mean, sponge-cakes?

447
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:20,191
It's a birthday
present for Jeff.

448
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:21,954
Larry, he's not
fat enough as it is?

449
00:21:21,994 --> 00:21:24,656
He needs this many?
This is ridiculous.

450
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:27,860
It's from Butterman's.
They're going out of business.

451
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,731
The sponge-cakes from the party
he loved so much.

452
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:31,360
He loved it so much
to have a slice,

453
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:34,804
not 25. How many are there?
It's ridiculous.

454
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,037
- They can last five years.
- What, am I gonna freeze them?

455
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:40,545
They're not even in boxes.
Where are the boxes?

456
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:43,275
They're out of boxes.
They only had Saran Wrap.

457
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:46,045
So they wrapped them up
and you brought them here?

458
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:48,144
You don't understand.
They're going out of business.

459
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:50,052
Larry, he's gonna explode.
He's fat!

460
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,956
...never going
to be made again, this is it.

461
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:54,823
I understand.
Should I care?

462
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,351
- Hey, congratulations.
- Congratulations on what?

463
00:21:57,396 --> 00:21:59,523
The baby.
Congratulations.

464
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:02,193
How did you know
about that?

465
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:04,828
- A big bird told me.
- You knew I was pregnant?

466
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,963
- What?
- Jeff told you I was pregnant?

467
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:09,497
- Well, I didn't...
- It's bad luck!

468
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,942
- In the first three months...
- That's a silly superstition.

469
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:15,742
And you told her?
I don't even know her.

470
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:17,772
Who the hell is she?
It's not your fault...

471
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:21,252
- I didn't tell you...
- Yes, you did.

472
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:24,278
You know what?
All right, look,

473
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:28,384
why don't you come in and
we'll have a little interview?

474
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:30,190
You look like
a lovely woman.

475
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:31,594
This might work out...
I don't know

476
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,224
what you want me to do.
I have no place to put them.

477
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:37,633
I don't have a freezer
that's adequate for this.

478
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,297
Put them down
in the kitchen.

479
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:41,966
Put them in the kitchen.
Martine, dear, come in.

480
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:43,998
- Okay.
- Okay?

481
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:57,855
- How are you doing?
- I'm nauseated.

482
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,620
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

483
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,957
You already did it.
It's not a live performance.

484
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:04,895
It's already...
you already filmed it.

485
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,490
You're gonna sit there.
It's good, I've seen it.

486
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:11,025
- HBO likes it, right?
- Yeah, they do like it.

487
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,664
So there you go.
Are they here now?

488
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:15,674
No, they don't come.

489
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,903
No, they see it
in their private homes.

490
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:19,672
"The privacy of their homes"?

491
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:22,203
Is that the proper way
of saying that sentence?

492
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:24,943
You know, you're like
an English language cop.

493
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:27,850
It's unbelievable.
By the way, I was thinking,

494
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:30,787
maybe you can introduce me
to that Bartlett's guy.

495
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:34,054
Maybe I could schmooze
a little bit before the special.

496
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:36,994
Yeah, well, there's a little
problem with that.

497
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:38,291
What do you mean?

498
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,230
I don't know if you'll get
that quote in.

499
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:42,062
- I'm not sure anymore.
- Why?

500
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:44,069
He talked to him
about the penis.

501
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:46,731
- I broached the subject.
- Why would you do that?

502
00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:48,899
I was just curious.

503
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:51,910
- Now I'm not gonna get in.
- Not the Bartlett's.

504
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:54,742
You're kidding,
is she okay?

505
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,907
You should never have
brought it up, Larry. Fuck.

506
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:58,974
All right,
I'll be right home.

507
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:00,985
Your nanny
attacked Susie.

508
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,850
What?

509
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:04,879
Is she okay?

510
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:08,954
Hey, do you want me to...?

511
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:12,430
This whole night
is turning out to... oh, Christ.

512
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:14,432
- Don't worry, we'll call.
- Should I go?

513
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:16,559
- I can't watch this now.
- Go?

514
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:18,536
If you leave me now,
I collapse.

515
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,629
You "clapse"?

516
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:22,537
Yeah, I'll collapse.

517
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:24,371
What's wrong with...
yeah, I mean...

518
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:26,604
- I need you here.
- You say it the same way I do.

519
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:29,705
- "Collapse," I say.
- No, "C-L-A-P-S-E."

520
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:32,478
You don't say "co-llapse,"
you say "claps."

521
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:36,543
- Who's that?
- That's the kid.

522
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:38,886
- That's the "porn baby"?
- That's the porn baby.

523
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:40,949
Why is the porn baby here?

524
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:44,622
Because he fired his nanny.
He doesn't have a nanny.

525
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:46,290
He has to take care
of the kid now.

526
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:47,662
I don't want a little kid
watching my specials.

527
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:50,827
His father's here too,
so I guess he decided to come.

528
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:52,837
I don't want a baby
in the screening.

529
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:55,271
That's a good sign
for the quote.

530
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:57,298
He's here, he came.

531
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:01,210
Oh, Christ,
that really was great,

532
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:02,838
but it's too much
and it threw me.

533
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:06,840
Shh, shh, shh.

534
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:09,752
I took some time off and
I was a little burned out.

535
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:12,655
- I hate this show.
- It's a grown-up show.

536
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:15,888
I have to sit through your cartoons,
you watch this one.

537
00:25:17,362 --> 00:25:20,388
- I want popcorn.
- It's not that kind of theater.

538
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:23,959
- I want a soda.
- Hey, shh.

539
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:27,471
Shh, yourself.

540
00:25:27,506 --> 00:25:30,805
You shush. Shush!

541
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:33,209
- You shh, "poopyhead."
- No, you shush, dodo brain.

542
00:25:33,245 --> 00:25:35,236
- You're a dodo brain.
- You're a dodo brain.

543
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,182
No, these are all new
and improved dysfunctions.

544
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:42,745
- I want to go home.
- As soon as it's over, we'll go home.

545
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:44,915
- Shh, quiet.
- You be quiet, big nose.

546
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:49,018
- Look who's talking.
- Don't talk to my kid, okay?

547
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:51,689
Why don't you get Uncle Miltie
out of here so we can watch this?

548
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,664
- You're stupid.
- You're stupid.

549
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:56,566
- You're more stupid.
- You're much, much stupider.

550
00:25:56,602 --> 00:25:58,900
- No, I'm not, you are.
- No, you are.

551
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:02,830
Don't speak to us again, all right?
I'm warning you.

552
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:05,469
He wouldn't be here
if you didn't fire that nanny.

553
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,502
I wouldn't have had to fire her
if some asshole didn't bribe her.

554
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:11,414
Fuck h-yoo.

555
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,042
Fuck you.

556
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:14,882
Fuck Hugh!

557
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,945
Hugh!

558
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:19,082
Hugh!

559
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:25,928
Everything okay?
I called three times last night.

560
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:29,229
I haven't checked the messages.
I've been unbelievably busy.

561
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:32,601
- How is she doing? Is she okay?
- Go up and ask her.

562
00:26:32,638 --> 00:26:35,232
- Is the baby...?
- She's upstairs. Go up and ask her.

563
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:37,868
Superstition... she was right,
you never should have told me.

564
00:26:43,282 --> 00:26:45,978
Larry, come in.

565
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:49,647
Oh my God, I'm so sorry
about the nanny and everything.

566
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:52,384
Larry, that nanny,
she was a sicko.

567
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:54,756
She was a mental case.
She was sick.

568
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:57,261
What, the nanny?
Oh my God.

569
00:26:57,296 --> 00:27:00,129
- She was mentally ill.
- I didn't know anything about that,

570
00:27:00,165 --> 00:27:01,860
or I'd never have
recommended her.

571
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,198
No, of course. Why would you
send me a sicko?

572
00:27:04,236 --> 00:27:06,534
Why would I do that?
That would make me deranged.

573
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:09,369
Well, she needs to be
put away, this woman.

574
00:27:09,408 --> 00:27:10,841
Well, what happened?

575
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:13,276
I left Sammy alone
in her room watching TV.

576
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:25,656
All of a sudden,
she starts screaming.

577
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:28,285
Mommy! Mommy!

578
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:32,195
I ran in... the nanny...

579
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,198
is like watching
some "Looney Tunes" cartoon

580
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:37,133
- and went crazy.
- Oh, yeah. You know why?

581
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:40,434
She worked at that
"Looney Tunes" Lodge for 15 years

582
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:43,066
and she kept hearing
that song over and over.

583
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:46,099
Yeah, yeah.

584
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:47,941
She must have snapped
from hearing it.

585
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,279
Larry, she went crazy,
I'm telling you.

586
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,375
- She started going wacky.
- What did she do?

587
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:55,215
She starts fighting with me.

588
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:57,221
She grabbed my arm.

589
00:27:57,255 --> 00:27:59,917
She starts pulling me
back and forth.

590
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,085
All of a sudden, I'm fighting
with this crazy woman.

591
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:04,027
I mean, physically fighting.

592
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:06,189
Next thing I knew,
we were out on the deck.

593
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:08,199
Out on the deck?

594
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:11,031
Yeah, like struggling
and fighting.

595
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:12,832
Oh my God.
And then what happened?

596
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:16,534
She pushed me
over the rail.

597
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:18,543
This crazy woman
pushed me over the rail.

598
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:20,238
She was trying to kill me!

599
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:23,874
Well, how...

600
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:25,815
Here's the thing, Lar.

601
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:28,445
My fall was broken by...

602
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:33,949
12 sponge-cakes.
