0
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,846
Puffy shirt, puffy shirt.

1
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,618
Can you spare a little change
for an old buccaneer?

2
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:28,286
You know, it's really
not a bad-looking shirt.

3
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,660
- All right, good show.
- Good show.

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,267
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh my God.

5
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,269
Don't answer it.
I don't want to talk to her.

6
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,601
Well, why does she have
to call after every episode?

7
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,472
Oh, don't...
I'm not here.

8
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,874
Hello?

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,343
Hi, Marilyn.

10
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,905
Uh, yeah,
we just watched it.

11
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:53,146
Yeah, I know, it's...
it was one of the good ones.

12
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:57,054
Um, he's actually...
he's unavailable.

13
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,853
Mm-hmm.

14
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,986
Uh, okay, bye.

15
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:05,589
"Tell him it was one
of my favorite episodes.

16
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,099
It made me
laugh so hard.

17
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,829
I swear, it gets better
every time I see it."

18
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,236
I can't believe this woman
has to call after every single show.

19
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,639
Every... I mean, does it
ever end with this lady?

20
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,473
What are you
doing tomorrow?

21
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,275
I'm getting my physical
for "The Producers."

22
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,339
Can you do me
a favor?

23
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,975
Will you pick up a...

24
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,248
a present for the Dusenberrys'
baby shower?

25
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,517
- Me?
- You're gonna be right there.

26
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,923
- There's a toy store...
- You would entrust me that?

27
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,551
A gift for a baby?

28
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,653
Just get a doll
or something.

29
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:40,291
So you want me to get
a doll for Betty?

30
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,961
Get a doll for Betty.
It's her baby shower.

31
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,527
Well, what about the surrogate?
Get her anything?

32
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,040
I don't think you need
to worry about the surrogate.

33
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,974
Well, I don't
know about that.

34
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,000
I think the surrogate
is a person, too.

35
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,842
She's having the baby.

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,348
The shower is
for Betty.

37
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,940
She's gonna be
opening her presents.

38
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,976
The surrogate's standing there
like an idiot and has nothing to open?

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,647
What's the surrogate
etiquette?

40
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,022
Okay, use your judgment,
whatever you think.

41
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,051
If that's what you
want to do, that's fine.

42
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,400
Hey, Charlie,
what's going on there?

43
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,402
Ah, what? What?

44
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,529
Come on, you know
I can't do anything.

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,808
Because the dog
bit your penis?

46
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,675
Yes.

47
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,871
And so you're...

48
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,145
It's not ready.
I'm not ready.

49
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:35,245
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
A couple more days.

50
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,901
Mr. David?

51
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,005
Can I make
an observation?

52
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,875
That magazine
collection,

53
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,107
you really need to do
something about that.

54
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,913
I'm not complaining. I'm just...
just making an observation.

55
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,613
Well, the doctor's
ready to see you.

56
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,451
Okay.

57
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,719
Just, you know,
just for your information,

58
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,316
FYI kind of thing.

59
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,260
- It's right that way.
- Okay.

60
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,988
What are you doing,

61
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,092
stealing your magazines
from garbage cans?

62
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,729
I have never seen such
a collection of shit in my life.

63
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,739
They're all four years old,
those things.

64
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,673
We have other things
that we think about

65
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,836
other than the magazines,
like giving people medical assistance.

66
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,041
"Ladies Home Journal"
from 2001.

67
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,517
"People" magazine.
"Tom Cruise is 40!"

68
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,349
- "Emilio Estevez is 40!"
- Just... just keep walking. Okay.

69
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,854
Wow!

70
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,857
"Good for them,
they're 40!"

71
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,756
it sounds like
you're reading a lot

72
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,353
- of these magazines you don't like.
- It was right on the cover.

73
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,590
Yeah, you got a lot
of that stuff memorized.

74
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,599
Give me a "Golf" magazine
or something.

75
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,601
I got the point.
We got it, gotcha.

76
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,398
Get "Nation."
How about "Nation"?

77
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,928
Do you read "Nation"?
It's a fabulous magazine.

78
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,464
I have read "Nation."
That's a good one.

79
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,703
- Hey, Larry.
- Hi, Renee.

80
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,904
How you feeling?

81
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,140
- Good.
- Good.

82
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,090
- Larry, how you feeling?
- Okay.

83
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:27,828
Unfortunately, I can't give you
a clean bill of health at this point.

84
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,528
Yeah, I don't know
what happened.

85
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,799
There was a little,
slight abnormality.

86
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,501
We were going along great,
and you kind of spiked a little there.

87
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,999
And I can't sign
the form for you.

88
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:45,241
Believe me, there's nothing wrong
with me. I'm fine.

89
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,254
Jack, I'm fine.
Trust me, I'm fine.

90
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,153
Larry, I can't
sign the form for you

91
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:54,421
without taking some precautions, okay?
Here's what we're gonna do.

92
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,620
It's simple, come on.

93
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,562
There's no
irregularity.

94
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,121
Yes, there is, Larry.

95
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,531
I went to medical school.
I know.

96
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,502
So what we're gonna do is this.
Listen, it's simple:

97
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,062
I'm gonna give you a device
called a heart halter.

98
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,937
This is ridiculous.

99
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,637
Larry, I have to do it.
I have to do it.

100
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,306
It straps on,
a couple of electrodes.

101
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,713
You wear it for 24 hours.
It measures your heartbeat.

102
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:20,879
You come back and if this was
an abnormality, an aberration,

103
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,251
the device
will confirm it.

104
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,256
You get back on the treadmill
for five minutes,

105
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,019
I sign the slip,
and you're off to Broadway.

106
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,651
- Renee?
- Yes?

107
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,060
Do you have the halter?
You want to give that to Larry?

108
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,223
I'm gonna schedule you
for an appointment tomorrow.

109
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,995
- Let Renee do this, will you please?
- Will you stand up?

110
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,025
Will you take off
your jacket, Larry?

111
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,197
Great.

112
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,728
It's really easy.

113
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,742
There we go.
There you go.

114
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,336
That's it.

115
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,370
There.

116
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,447
I got to tell you
what happened last night.

117
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,650
You know, I took Renee home,
you know. We stopped and uh...

118
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,658
Yeah, I just saw her
at Dr. Jack's.

119
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,286
- She's unbelievable.
- She's beyond unbelievable.

120
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,693
But the point
of it is that l...

121
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,291
Look, have you ever made it
with an African-American?

122
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,324
Yes. Twice.

123
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,360
What, the same one twice?

124
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,996
Two different ones.

125
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,530
- Same time?
- No, same time... two different ones.

126
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,510
I'll tell you right now,
for some reason I never...

127
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,512
I never did it with...
with a black...

128
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,104
You never met...
you never met one or...

129
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,740
No, no one I really,
you know...

130
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,410
Okay, so she'll
be the first.

131
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:29,182
This woman's extraordinary.
So here's the thing:

132
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,383
A couple of months ago
I went to a Knicks game.

133
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,982
And I went
into the locker room

134
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,993
to say hello to some
of my friends.

135
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,585
They were showering
and I looked.

136
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,119
I saw one of the forwards.

137
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,632
And he threw the towel off.
He was getting dressed,

138
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,031
and I looked down.
I saw...

139
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,433
- Big. Yeah.
- Big?

140
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,868
Uh, huge?

141
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,304
Big? They could put
the Chicago fire out with this.

142
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,864
It was...
it was a joke.

143
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,138
- Well...
- It was like from another planet.

144
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,974
Well, he's a big guy.
He's a forward.

145
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,003
You need to see a guard.
Did you see a guard?

146
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,709
You can't tell by a forward.
They're too big, out of proportion.

147
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,116
I don't care.
It's me and Renee,

148
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:03,020
and maybe because...
maybe because, you know,

149
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,080
she's black,
she maybe dates, you know...

150
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,092
So you think the black woman
might be used to a...

151
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:10,527
I mean, if they're used...
I mean, if that... if that's not a myth...

152
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,292
I could see how
it could be a concern.

153
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,595
I don't know whether I would
ever want to have intercourse

154
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,727
with her, because I'm
a little intimidated.

155
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,135
And you're one of the few
friends I can tell this to.

156
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:23,632
Okay, well, then maybe
I can... I can step in.

157
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,144
I got that 10th
anniversary present.

158
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,409
I'm saying if you
want to, you know...

159
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,940
if you're too intimidated
to go through with it, I could try.

160
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,815
A good friend
doesn't do that.

161
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,821
You don't...
you don't have intercourse

162
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,948
with someone who
your friend doesn't screw.

163
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,652
Why? It would be a nice
10th anniversary present for me.

164
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,287
I'd rather go to Tiffany's
and get you a bowl.

165
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,297
I don't
want a bowl.

166
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,322
All right.

167
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,403
Here you go.

168
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,928
Yeah, I'm not
the valet.

169
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,565
Oh, I'm sor...

170
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,202
It is possible for black people
to have other jobs.

171
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,212
No no,
I know, of course.

172
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,646
- I already know. Thanks.
- No, because...

173
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,583
- It's because I'm black.
- I'm sorry.

174
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,677
Yeah.
You fucked up.

175
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,984
Sorry.

176
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,815
Sorry.

177
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,334
So you automatically think
the black man is the valet, huh?

178
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,396
- No, I don't automatically...
- Yes, you did. I saw it.

179
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,567
No, he's standing
by the valet...

180
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,770
"Get my car, boy."
I saw it, Larry.

181
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,109
He had on a white shirt
and a red tie and a vest.

182
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:37,081
He's standing by the valet sign.
It's an honest mistake.

183
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,107
Oh, yeah yeah,
that's honest.

184
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,142
Anytime I see a black man
in a tie and a suit,

185
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,382
I think, "Hey, you must
park cars for a living."

186
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,617
I feel it was
an honest mistake, Wanda.

187
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,593
No no, if it was a white man
standing here, you would not.

188
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,028
I would have given him
the valet. I would too.

189
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,031
- No, you wouldn't.
- I would too have.

190
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,295
- No, you would have asked him, not.
- Too too.

191
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,201
You would have asked him
for a stock tip or...

192
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,467
- where do you golf?
- Oh, yeah, right.

193
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,667
How's the filming going?

194
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,835
It's good.
I'm shooting over there.

195
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,572
On my little break.

196
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,739
Let me ask you
a question.

197
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:12,080
You've slept with a lot of white men
and black men, I'm sure.

198
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,882
- Is there any discernible difference?
- What?

199
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,549
Let me rephrase that.
Let me rephrase that.

200
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,114
Yeah, rephrase that.

201
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,887
Is there any
discernible difference

202
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:25,159
between a white man
and a black man...

203
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:28,894
you know...

204
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,302
Why would you ask me
something like that, Larry?

205
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,332
My friend wants to know.
Why, what's the big deal?

206
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,934
I am not gonna
answer that.

207
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,876
What is that? What the fuck?
What are you doing?

208
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,817
It's a bug, a bug.
I had a bug on me.

209
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,753
Look, did you get my script
to that guy, that Martin Schaffer?

210
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,780
Everything's okay since
you want your little favor.

211
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,519
- Did he get my script?
- Yes, he did.

212
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,117
- And?
- And what?

213
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,425
I gave it to him.
He'll read it and get back to you.

214
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,158
He's not gonna
rewrite it, is he?

215
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,429
- No.
- Okay, 'cause that's my baby.

216
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,028
- Oh yeah yeah.
- I don't want anybody messing with it.

217
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,734
- No one's going to.
- I'm going back to work.

218
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,867
- Go back to work, yeah.
- Messing with you.

219
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,778
Is there any black men
around here to... is there a valet?

220
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,146
I need a black man
to get my car.

221
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,276
Is there a black man
in the area

222
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,752
who wants to take
my valet ticket?

223
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,925
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, hi.

224
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,591
- Do you work here?
- Sure.

225
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,931
Is this the only doll?

226
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,936
Yeah, that's
the only one left.

227
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,733
- That's it?
- Yeah, last one.

228
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,865
- Huh.
- Isn't that cute?

229
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,680
- What's the race on this doll?
- It's biracial.

230
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,547
- Biracial? Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

231
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,280
Huh.

232
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,619
So they make this doll
specifically for mixed couples?

233
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,558
For black
and white couples?

234
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,527
They make a doll
for their kids?

235
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,392
I don't know.

236
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,796
If somebody's Asian,
and they marry a white person,

237
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,665
are they making sort of a half-Asian,
half-white doll too?

238
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,863
See what
I'm getting at?

239
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,428
Yeah.

240
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,099
I think that's... yeah.

241
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,939
Hmm, I wonder
if you do.

242
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,279
Okay. Um,
well, I guess 'll take it.

243
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,078
Excellent, let me
wrap it up for you.

244
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,414
- Okay.
- Okay.

245
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:33,051
Oh, surprise,
it says meow.

246
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,753
Isn't that
adorable?

247
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,321
Oh, I love it. Thank you
so much. That's so sweet.

248
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,202
Thank you.
You made it.

249
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,403
What... what is this?

250
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,106
- My heart. It's to monitor my heart.
- What?

251
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,011
No, I'm fine.
There was an aberration...

252
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,175
- That's heavy.
- No, I've got wires under there.

253
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,185
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm fine.

254
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,686
What does that mean?

255
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,155
Nothing. There was
something wrong with the machine.

256
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,714
The doctor
wouldn't sign off.

257
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,022
- How long do you have to wear this?
- Just a day.

258
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,051
Doesn't Bernie
look like Steve Demarco?

259
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,757
- No.
- Are you kidding?

260
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,697
He looks exactly like him.

261
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,701
They don't look
anything alike.

262
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,362
Anytime I ever
point out that

263
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,928
somebody looks like someone else,
you always disagree.

264
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,668
- Because they never do.
- They always do.

265
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,370
- Hey, she's opening our gift.
- Oh, good.

266
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,276
This is
from the Davids.

267
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,837
Oh, a doll.

268
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,645
It's a mulatto.

269
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,945
No good?

270
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,083
biracial is what
we call it, usually.

271
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,721
Biracial. Hmm, what do you
know about that?

272
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,924
They gave us
another one, too.

273
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,660
That's actually
for the surrogate.

274
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,229
Oh.

275
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,608
Well, that's it, gang.

276
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:02,410
Um, why don't we have
some coffee or some dessert?

277
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,416
'Cause that's it.
That's all the gifts.

278
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,418
Thank you guys
for coming.

279
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,942
What?

280
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,848
- Hi.
- Hey.

281
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,383
Thank you so much.

282
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,395
- You're welcome.
- I didn't expect it.

283
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,829
You're the one carrying
the baby. That's your baby.

284
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,060
I wouldn't expect them to,
but thank you.

285
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,035
- It's very unnecessary.
- Yeah.

286
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,401
- What do you do?
- I'm a writer.

287
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,429
Oh, that's cool.

288
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,442
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

289
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,536
Sometimes, though,
it's not such a great job.

290
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,377
You know, like for example,
I got this friend.

291
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,883
She just gave a script
to me to give to somebody.

292
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:43,355
She said, "Don't let him touch my baby,"
you know. That's what they do.

293
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,721
You work on something
for months and months,

294
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:49,091
then they take it
away from you,

295
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,062
and then that's it.

296
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,530
You never see it again.
They take your baby from you,

297
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,467
they give your baby
to somebody else, and that's it.

298
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,097
You've lost complete
contact with your baby.

299
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,869
You never see the baby again,
and it's your baby.

300
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,705
And they give it
to another writer.

301
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,268
And that writer doesn't let
you even look at your baby.

302
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,781
That's part of your job.
That's what you signed up for.

303
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,544
You knew you had to
give it away.

304
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,644
Sort of, but it's hard
to give up that baby.

305
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,281
Maybe in a few years you can see
how your script's doing.

306
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,291
Yeah, I know, but then
it's all changed.

307
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,556
You have nothing
to do with it.

308
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,723
All right. You wanna get
some coffee?

309
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,699
No way out.

310
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,640
It was shocking,
outrageous, insulting,

311
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,643
and I loved
every minute of it.

312
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,770
- No way out.
- Hey!

313
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,804
How are you?
How are you?

314
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:43,872
Hey.

315
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,747
I am thoroughly
impressed.

316
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:46,910
Well, oh, come on.

317
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,512
Yes, surprisingly good.

318
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,490
Still on the book? You don't have it
under your belt yet?

319
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,185
Funny you should
mention that.

320
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,751
Why is-is...
I mean...

321
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,286
We open... dude, we open
in three and a half weeks.

322
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,821
Yeah, I know.

323
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,993
Every time you work,
he always has the scripts?

324
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,662
Yes, every time.

325
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,763
I'll be fine. I have a little problem
memorizing stuff.

326
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,967
Did you guys get
your test results back?

327
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,636
The insurance company's
been bugging me.

328
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,611
Yes yes, yeah yeah,
I got mine. Here.

329
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,706
Clean bill of health,
flying colors I might add.

330
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,445
Ooh, results!
I'm proud of you.

331
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,975
Where's your
little paper?

332
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,545
I had a little
bit of a... problem.

333
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,682
What the hell
is that?

334
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,521
What is that?

335
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,027
- Yeah, I didn't...
- What is that?

336
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,554
- It's called a heart halter.
- Heart halter?

337
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,727
I'm fine, I'm fine. I just
didn't pass the physical, that's all.

338
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,602
- What?
- There's nothing wrong with me.

339
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,198
Are you too old for this?
Is that what he said?

340
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,210
No, I'm not too old for it,
believe me. It was a fluke.

341
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,235
I'm fine. There's
nothing wrong with me.

342
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,645
After three shuffle-ball chains,
he's winded.

343
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,774
You wanna race me?

344
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:54,081
- You want to go to the parking lot?
- I'll go right now.

345
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,087
Put your sneakers on.

346
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,679
I don't need sneakers...

347
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,350
Let's stop
being juvenile.

348
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,792
You can't win. Let's not race him.
Now look, folks.

349
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,295
Excuse me. Hey, Dad.

350
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,230
You don't think
I could beat him in a race?

351
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,926
I don't think you can
beat him in a race.

352
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,491
Oh, can I tell you
what happened?

353
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,560
I'm on the treadmill
taking the stress test...

354
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,400
I got the pictures
from Spain.

355
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,202
Yeah, I thought
you might like that.

356
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,730
Oh, that's excellent.

357
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,243
She comes in that room again
tomorrow when I take the test,

358
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,075
I look at the ceiling.
I can tell you that.

359
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,603
Okay, that's great.

360
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,809
All right, I think
you're gonna be fine.

361
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,650
There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm fine. Did I just spit on you?

362
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,780
- No no no.
- Okay, 'cause you went like that.

363
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,415
No no, I always do that.
When I sweat...

364
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,858
You're always
rubbing your face I noticed.

365
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,191
Victor McLaglan
and Adolphe Menjou,

366
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,754
Gypo, Gypo Nolan,
remember from "The Informer"?

367
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,256
Gypo, Gypo Nolan...

368
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,826
Gypo Nolan.

369
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,838
Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Mr. Brooks?

370
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,840
Can I introduce you
to my dad?

371
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,536
My dad's a huge fan.
This is Irving.

372
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,442
Irving Schwimmer,
pleasure to meet you.

373
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,946
Yes, pleasure
meeting you.

374
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,948
I'm looking forward
to seeing your show.

375
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,143
I've been a fan
of yours for years.

376
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,017
I appreciate that. Would you guys
excuse me for one minute?

377
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,648
Yeah yeah yeah.
Isn't that awesome?

378
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,123
You finally
got to meet him.

379
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,955
Yes, I finally did.

380
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,551
So you like
those pictures, huh?

381
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,790
- Yeah...
- Good, good.

382
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,229
Dad, this is Larry.

383
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,733
Hi, how you doing?
Nice to meet you.

384
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,963
- Right.
- These are great.

385
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,437
- My parents went to Spain.
- Oh!

386
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,201
Well, I'd better
be taking off, okay?

387
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,675
Are those genitals?
What is that on that bull?

388
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,699
No, that's...

389
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,302
Oh my God.

390
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,974
All right, Dad.

391
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,052
You told him about the whole
cashew-raisin thing, right?

392
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,489
We were talking. You didn't
have to go back and tell him, "Larry..."

393
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,686
- Are you kidding?
- I know you said something.

394
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,661
- He was so unfriendly.
- Of course I said something.

395
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,027
It was your suggestion,
Mr. Constructive Criticism.

396
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,999
He's putting
four cashews in a bag.

397
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,058
He deserves some
constructive criticism.

398
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,468
- Go on about it.
- I want to call him, seriously.

399
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,166
- I don't think so.
- I'd like to call him and apologize.

400
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,573
I don't feel comfortable
with you calling my dad.

401
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,577
David, I'm going
to apologize.

402
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,707
- I'm gonna be very nice. I promise.
- Okay.

403
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,341
Just call
before 7:00.

404
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,353
- All right, what's his number?
- 310-858...

405
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,396
This is Irving Schwimmer.
Please leave a message at the tone.

406
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,299
Oh, hi, Mr. Schwimmer.

407
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:34,870
Uh, this is Larry David.
I just want to say...

408
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,505
you fucking asshole!

409
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,312
What's your fucking
problem, you prick?

410
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,978
Jesus!

411
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,850
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

412
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,550
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

413
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,957
What are you doing?
You bumped into my car!

414
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,723
You think I hit your car?
Now I'm gonna hit you in the head.

415
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,458
Oh, my heart!

416
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,228
What are you doing?
What is this?

417
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:59,260
Is it your heart? All right,
just calm down. Don't take them off.

418
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,067
You shouldn't have
took them off.

419
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,074
All right, uh...

420
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,406
Look... oh, Christ.
I don't know CPR.

421
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,309
Hey, somebody call
an ambulance.

422
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,813
Call an ambulance!
Call 911!

423
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,712
Send 'em to the park,
come on.

424
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,478
Oh!

425
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,419
Hang in there. Can you breathe?
Keep breathing, all right?

426
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,252
Whatever you do, don't stop
breathing. Keep doing that.

427
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,918
You got a phone?

428
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,483
Seriously,
the guy was...

429
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,860
the guy was coming after me
with a tire iron.

430
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,990
I faked
the whole thing.

431
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,659
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

432
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,827
This is ridiculous.
There's nothing wrong with me.

433
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,703
This is just so unnecessary.
Seriously.

434
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,955
I've dated both...
black men, white men

435
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,125
and there really
isn't a difference.

436
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,362
It's... it's really
just kind of a myth.

437
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,894
That's a myth? Boy,
too bad for the black guys.

438
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,566
I know. I know.

439
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,098
I speak from both sides.
I'm half-black and half-white.

440
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,907
Get out of town.
I bought a mulatto doll today.

441
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,244
Okay, um,

442
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,943
we don't really use
mulatto anymore...

443
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,181
I was wondering about that,
if that was a bad one.

444
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,713
Yeah, it's a bit outdated.
But if we all keep fucking each other,

445
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,952
then we're gonna be the same race
sooner or later anyways.

446
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,824
- Let's pray for that.
- I do.

447
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,351
- Hello.
- Are you okay?

448
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,023
Hey, this is Masasa.

449
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,896
Hi, I'm Cheryl.
Nice to meet you.

450
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,662
Do you think...
do you think that...

451
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,160
a biracial person would need
sunblock? Would you think that?

452
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,867
- I have not thought about it.
- I guess you had to be there.

453
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,105
- We were having a conversation.
- Are you all right?

454
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,169
Mrs. David,
it was lovely meeting you.

455
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,078
And good luck to you
and your friend.

456
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,707
Thank you.

457
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,081
Oh my God,
what happened?

458
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,178
- Oh, I'm perfectly fine.
- Are you?

459
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,018
Absolutely,
perfectly fine.

460
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,025
It was a road rage incident,
and a guy came out of his car

461
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,186
with a tire iron.
He was gonna kill me.

462
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,889
So you know,
I had the heart halter,

463
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,558
and I faked like I was having
a heart attack. I pulled the wires out...

464
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,089
You did what?

465
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,227
I faked like I was
having a heart attack

466
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,830
so he wouldn't kill me.

467
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,772
So there's nothing
wrong with you?

468
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,934
No, I'm fine.

469
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,967
Then why am I here?

470
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:24,813
Why are you in
a hospital bed right now?

471
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,511
What are you
talking about?

472
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,543
They took me to the hospital
because of the heart attack.

473
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,522
So you're taking up
a hospital bed

474
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,081
because you're afraid of
some weird guy in traffic?

475
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,560
Weird guy had a tire iron.
He was gonna kill me.

476
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,563
You're in the hospital.
If you're calling me

477
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,430
to rush over to help you,
I'd think something was wrong with you.

478
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,162
You'd rather come in here
and see me with broken limbs?

479
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,170
Well, I'd rather
not come in here

480
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,967
and see you chatting
with the nurse.

481
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,234
I'm not allowed
to talk to a nurse?

482
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,265
You're having
a good time in the hospital!

483
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,107
You wanted somebody
to kill me?

484
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,545
Is that what you wanted?
You would prefer that?

485
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,175
By the way, what did
you say to the surrogate?

486
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,685
She's gone into labor.
She's here at the hospital,

487
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,585
and she's not gonna
give the baby up.

488
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,590
What did you
tell her?

489
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,592
She said she had
a talk with you.

490
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,491
I didn't say anything.

491
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,497
You must have said something
because Bernie is looking for you

492
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,123
'cause he wants
to kick your ass.

493
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,963
That's a quote?

494
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,868
That's a quote.

495
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,839
Those bastards.
The fourth time I've been here,

496
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:25,365
and I still can't get this
colostomy bag to fit. It doesn't fit.

497
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,640
And the insurance company
won't pay for it.

498
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,647
It's full all the time.

499
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,980
I don't understand why they
just don't take care of it.

500
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,581
What are you doing?

501
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,019
You can't keep
that baby!

502
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,080
I was talking
about a script.

503
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,183
I want that
panda back!

504
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,354
So you know, I spoke
to this this nurse.

505
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,261
She's biracial.

506
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,425
Bi, what do you
mean biracial?

507
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,300
- Half-black, half-white... mulatto.
- Bisexual?

508
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,827
They don't say mulatto anymore.
She got mad at me.

509
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,067
Anyway, she said she's been
with black and white men,

510
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,803
and she said there's
no difference so...

511
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,811
- Really?
- Yeah.

512
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,676
That's fantastic.

513
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,477
Look at that.
Look at that.

514
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,916
- How fantastic is that?
- Isn't that good news?

515
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,216
Wow, I'm really...
this is great news, by the way.

516
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,881
I'm gonna see Renee
this afternoon.

517
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,117
- I got my physical again, yeah.
- Wow, cool.

518
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,490
Did I tell you that
Bernie Dusenberry's

519
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,461
gonna kick my ass?
Did I mention that?

520
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,657
- You mean that big guy?
- Yeah, the big guy.

521
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,565
Wait wait wait,
let me ask you something.

522
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,000
Hey.

523
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,663
- Holy shit!
- Muggsy Bogues?

524
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,605
Yes.

525
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,505
I won't shake your hand.
I'm in a bathroom.

526
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,102
- I appreciate that.
- This man has bathroom etiquette.

527
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,308
- I haven't touched anything yet.
- I appreciate it.

528
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,782
- I'm a huge fan, man, huge fan.
- Thank you.

529
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,546
One of the great
guards of all time.

530
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,645
- We really enjoyed watching you play.
- Thank you.

531
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,656
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Same here.

532
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,351
Go ahead,
do your thing.

533
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,203
What the fuck?!

534
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,867
Why are you looking
at my dick?!

535
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,877
- You looking at me?
- No, I wasn't looking.

536
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,538
You crazy?

537
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,848
You okay?
Are you all right?

538
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:21,220
#... Will be king,
and be on top to stay #

539
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,250
# On top to stay, hey! #

540
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,696
Think I'm gonna
steal your car?

541
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:37,037
No no, it's just
I forgot to...

542
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,305
I forgot to just
put the alarm on.

543
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:43,178
It's not you.
It's no race thing.

544
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,614
No, no race thing.

545
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,139
Asshole.

546
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,776
No, I don't even
need the alarm on.

547
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,049
It's off. I turned
the alarm off, look.

548
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,586
Did it again, huh?

549
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:59,188
So what, the black man
in a suit parks cars.

550
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,667
Black man, no suit,
he gonna steal your car.

551
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:06,228
I can't do anything in this city
without you watching me, following me?

552
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,171
I told you I'm shooting
here all week.

553
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,505
He just happened to be there
when I turned to put the alarm on.

554
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,273
- That's not my fault.
- You saw the black man, you was like,

555
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,109
"Let me lock my car."
You put the alarm on.

556
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,047
The black man made you go,
"Let me lock the car."

557
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,608
No, I just hadn't done it
yet, that's all.

558
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,644
And do you think a black man
would want that piece of shit?

559
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,088
Piece of shit,
how dare you?!

560
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,887
No black man
don't want a toy car.

561
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,894
Black man want a car
with some get up and go.

562
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,658
I didn't think the black man
wanted the car.

563
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,495
So look, did you hear
back from Martin,

564
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,468
from Martin Schaffer
about my script?

565
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,629
- Yeah.
- And?

566
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:43,698
Sorry to say,
didn't like it.

567
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,267
It happens.

568
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,938
Well, did you tell him
I was black?

569
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,174
No.

570
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,978
Why didn't you
tell him I was black?

571
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,848
Oh, I don't know.
Why should I?

572
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,217
Larry, you don't know
when to play the card.

573
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:59,417
I mean, you know, white guys,
they love that shit.

574
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,857
You know,
"Oh, look at me. I'm liberal.

575
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:06,227
Helping the black person."
You should know better.

576
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,425
That's when you tell
somebody they're black.

577
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,435
All right, all right,
I'll tell him you're black, okay? Fine.

578
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,529
Tell him I'm like a brown-skinned black,
not light skinned.

579
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,404
Make sure he know
I'm real black.

580
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,604
I hope I don't see you for a while.
Getting sick of you.

581
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,909
Take your sick ass
in the hospital.

582
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,262
Mr. David.

583
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:52,170
Can I say that this is fantastic,
the magazines?

584
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,112
What an improvement,
unbelievable.

585
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,614
I got to tell
you something,

586
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,913
one of the few times in my life
anyone's taken my advice.

587
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,885
It's a pleasure.

588
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,016
- Well, the doctor's waiting to see you.
- Okay.

589
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,555
You know what
I say to you now?

590
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,325
- What do you say to me?
- Keep me waiting.

591
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,957
Can I tell you something?

592
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,161
It was the best waiting room
experience I've ever had.

593
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,466
- Glad you're happy.
- I'm very happy.

594
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,472
I'm seeing right here
that you're happy.

595
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,940
Nice job, and did you
notice I got "Golf"?

596
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:27,672
I saw the "Golf."
I picked up a nice tip.

597
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,839
Hey, Larry.

598
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,875
Hey.

599
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,457
Oh, Bernie Dusenberry
called.

600
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,290
I was able to reschedule
his appointment.

601
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,522
He'll be here
in 10 minutes.

602
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:45,927
Oh, very good,
thanks.

603
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,898
Bye, Larry.

604
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:57,768
And the dispenser was destroyed
virtually beyond recognition.

605
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,572
Poor kid.

606
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,102
So as he's telling the story,
he starts crying...

607
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,378
Oh, did I tell you that
the surrogate changed her mind?

608
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,113
She's gonna give the baby
to the Dusenberrys after all.

609
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,986
- Really? Hey, that's great.
- Yeah.

610
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,958
- Oh, I got some good news, too.
- You do?

611
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,655
- Penis is healed.
- Oh.

612
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,687
As soon as I get rid
of this heart halter,

613
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,291
I'm back
in business, baby.

614
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,527
I can't
do those things.

615
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,834
- It's Marilyn.
- Marilyn.

616
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:38,371
Don't pick it up.
I'm not talking to her tonight.

617
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,552
- Good night.
- Good night.

618
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,180
Hi, please leave
your name and number

619
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,248
and someone will get
back to you, thank you.

620
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,227
This is Irv Schwimmer.

621
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:54,129
You motherfucking, cocksucking,
son-of-a-bitch bastard!

622
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,463
Who the fuck do you
think you are?!

623
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,526
You bald son of a...
