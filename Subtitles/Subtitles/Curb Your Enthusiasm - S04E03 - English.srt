0
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,080
You know,
you should get

1
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,786
one of these
cordless vacuums!

2
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,317
Hey, Mikey boy!

3
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,697
- What?
- What? I'm talking.

4
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,566
Yeah? Sorry,
I was just listening to music.

5
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,572
You know what? You better
get a new girlfriend, all right?

6
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,597
'Cause this isn't gonna
last that much longer.

7
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,734
Yeah, well,
whose fault is it

8
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,745
that I don't have
a girlfriend anymore?

9
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,303
Hey, I did you a favor.
The problem is

10
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,372
it's hard to fix you up.
You're so particular.

11
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,613
I would like to be with an attractive woman,
yes. What guy wouldn't?

12
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,244
Not only does she have
to be good-looking,

13
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,450
- but she's going out with a blind man.
- So?

14
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,357
- She has to wait on hand and foot.
- So?

15
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,954
What matters to women is
what's on the inside of a fella.

16
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,192
Okay, first of all,
you've got nothing

17
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,223
inside of you, okay?
Let me just make that clear.

18
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:11,101
You are the most superficial
man I've ever met,

19
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,605
blind or sighted,
okay?

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,665
Be that as it may,
it's just not fair

21
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,438
that people get
to see her and I don't.

22
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,572
It's not fair everybody knows what
she looks like except you?

23
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,582
Right.
It's not fair.

24
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,880
- Did you get the corners?
- You know what I'll do?

25
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,116
Keep my eyes and ears open. Maybe
there's somebody I can fix you up with.

26
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,248
"I am Max Bialystock,

27
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,259
first producer ever

28
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,193
to do summer stock
in the winter.

29
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,287
You've all heard
of theater-in-the-round.

30
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,457
You're looking at the man
who invented theater..."

31
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,730
Argh! Argh!

32
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,968
Fuck!

33
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,457
There he is. Honey,
right here. He's right here.

34
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,963
I still can't see
out of this side.

35
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,464
- Hey.
- Hey!

36
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,364
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Christine, hey.

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,231
- You okay?
- Yeah. Thanks for coming.

38
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,736
Yeah, come on in.

39
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,761
- I got severe tire damage.
- That sucks.

40
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,331
- You know those signs? It's true.
- Awful.

41
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,568
Hang on a second.

42
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,204
- You got it?
- No.

43
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,375
Wait, just stop.
Stop.

44
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,646
- No, stop. Don't do anything.
- I'm not.

45
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,676
You've got to...
just stop.

46
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,451
Okay, now.

47
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,185
Okay.

48
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,627
Oh, man.

49
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,892
- You okay?
- Yeah, my car...

50
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,694
the gate crashed
right down on it.

51
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,395
We're taking Christine to yoga class
and then we'll go to rehearsal, okay?

52
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:52,063
- Oh, okay, yoghurt.
- Hmm?

53
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,505
Is that a prefix,
you think, "yo"?

54
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,101
Yo-ga, yo-ghurt.

55
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:00,112
Think that's related...
- ghurt, -ga?

56
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,239
They're both healthy things.
Yoghurt, yoga.

57
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,182
I don't think so.

58
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,310
Hey, I thought of some more yos.

59
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,149
- Yodel, have you ever yodeled?
- Bye, honey.

60
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,615
Larry, great seeing you.

61
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,626
- Bye, Christine.
- Bye, guys.

62
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,185
How about what's-his-name,
from the movie?

63
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,459
She can't hear you.
Why don't you come up front?

64
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,524
Eh, I'm okay.

65
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,763
Come on up front.

66
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,102
I'm good.

67
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,405
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, why? What's the difference?

68
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,742
I'm not gonna drive you around
like a chauffeur. Get in the front seat.

69
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,010
You're not driving me around
like a chauffeur.

70
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,210
We're two minutes
from the rehearsal hall.

71
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,084
What kind of person asks another one
to drive them around like this?

72
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,747
This kind of mentality's
what's...

73
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,417
What kind of person is so insecure
that they have to make somebody

74
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,120
move into the front seat so they don't think
they're driving somebody around?

75
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,562
The kind of person that's so insecure
that needs to be driven around.

76
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,362
Subliminally you're telling me
you need me to drive you around.

77
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,561
Why do I have to leave my
seat, go into the front seat?

78
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,003
Because I asked you to,
and it's my car and if it's my car,

79
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,474
- I make the rules, okay?
- You're making the rules?

80
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:05,238
- We would have been there already.
- Yes, very good!

81
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,042
You can't drive with somebody
in the back seat.

82
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,878
You're such a baby.

83
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,851
- You're a grown man baby.
- Are you saying I'm a man-child?

84
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,819
I'm saying
you're a little baby.

85
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,947
Little baby wants a ride?
We'll give little baby a ride.

86
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,754
- You know what? Baby wants to walk.
- No no!

87
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,818
- I should have brought my baby seat...
- Little baby's gonna walk!

88
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,387
Mr. David, where to now?
Where to now, Mr. David?

89
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,127
Sorry if I didn't read
the rules getting into the car.

90
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,032
Here we go,
driving Mr. Larry.

91
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,661
Hey, take it easy, man.

92
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:35,231
- You're the baby, Larry.
- Oh, I'm the baby?

93
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,072
'Cause I want to take a poll,
that makes me a baby?

94
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,772
- No, you know what makes you a baby?
- What?

95
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,042
- The fact that you're a stupid baby!
- I'm a stupid...

96
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,912
Look at this thing you're
walking around with,

97
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,111
- a big sack on your back.
- It's my knapsack!

98
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,984
# They were helpless #

99
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,288
# They were hopeless #

100
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,092
# Then along came Bialy. #

101
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,360
Good morning!

102
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,424
- Hey, by the way...
- Hey, by the way.

103
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,630
your little cousin finished
all the Grape Nuts this morning.

104
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,502
He's a guest in our house,
we should just...

105
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,006
How much longer,
by the way?

106
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,009
I don't know,
three or four days.

107
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,534
I don't know.
We'll see. We'll see.

108
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,604
All right.

109
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,014
Hey, if it's okay with you,
I'm taking your car today.

110
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,518
I got a meeting
with Mel Brooks.

111
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,383
Oh, okay.

112
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,288
You know what? Maybe while you're out,
you could get it washed.

113
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,087
It looks pretty clean,
by the way.

114
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,150
- Do you mind?
- But it's totally clean.

115
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:31,061
- Good morning.
- Morning. I got to show you something.

116
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,361
- A card trick.
- Oh, a card trick, okay.

117
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,857
- Okay, you see this deck? One deck.
- Yeah.

118
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,030
Now you have to tell me
when to stop.

119
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,767
Stop.

120
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,775
Now this...

121
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,606
# Doo-doo, doo-doo #

122
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,511
...is your card
- Okay.

123
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,107
- I'd like you to shuffle this, please.
- All right.

124
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,880
Efficiently and
any way possible.

125
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,013
Okay, fine,
it's all shuffled.

126
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,758
Okay, and...

127
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,420
this is your card.

128
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,922
Wow!

129
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,093
- Yeah.
- How'd you do that?

130
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,564
I'm sorry,
I can't tell you.

131
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,802
- Sorry.
- Stewart, how'd you do the trick?

132
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,936
No, magicians don't tell people
how they do their tricks.

133
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:22,141
- Well, you're not really a magician.
- Oh, yeah, I am.

134
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,378
- One trick makes you a magician?
- Did I trick you?

135
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,380
Were you a magician before you knew
how to do that trick?

136
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,390
Mmm, not really.

137
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,449
Well, who taught you
how to do the trick?

138
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,017
A magician.

139
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,029
Okay, so you weren't
a magician.

140
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,860
A magician taught you
how to do the trick, right?

141
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,390
- Mmm-hmm, yeah.
- Okay, so I'm not a magician.

142
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,630
Now you're a magician,
so you teach me how to do it.

143
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,070
I can't, just 'cause
you said I am a magician,

144
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,596
I can't teach you.

145
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,939
You didn't know that trick
before the magician

146
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,774
- taught it to you, right?
- Yeah.

147
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,507
So why did the magician
tell you?

148
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,378
He can tell
that I'm a magician.

149
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,111
Well, you can tell
that I'm a magician.

150
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,619
But I'm a magician,
just naturally a magician.

151
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,622
That's what you're saying.
I'm saying I'm naturally a magician.

152
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,682
- But you don't know any tricks.
- And you're just not.

153
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,455
I mean, see,
because I'm a magician,

154
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,961
if you were naturally
a magician,

155
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,623
I'd feel that you were
naturally a magician.

156
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,929
- Are you gonna tell me this trick?
- No.

157
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,061
- Magicians don't reveal their secrets.
- Fine, I gotta go.

158
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,436
You guys are
a lot alike.

159
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,967
Yeah, except he's not
a magician.

160
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,013
Hey, let me
ask you something.

161
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,516
- You going to that Halloween party?
- Of course.

162
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,315
- You are?
- Yeah, we're taking you.

163
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,049
- You gonna wear a costume?
- Of course I'm wearing a costume,

164
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,580
- it's a Halloween party.
- I'm not gonna wear a costume!

165
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,663
Oh, I almost
didn't tell you.

166
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,392
So, last night
at about 11:30,

167
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,866
I go to the bathroom
to, uh, you know.

168
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,869
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

169
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,996
You got the energy for that
at 11:30 at night?

170
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,506
I always have
the energy, yeah.

171
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,031
- Kain ein horeh.
- Kain ein horeh.

172
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,738
So I'm thinking about
Jenna Jameson, you know?

173
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,475
- Who's she?
- A porn star, way hot.

174
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,881
And, um, all of a sudden,
she pops out.

175
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,249
You know who pops in?
You're not gonna believe this.

176
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,221
Cheryl.
Can you believe that?

177
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,622
- My wife?
- Cheryl, yeah.

178
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,953
What do you mean?
You used...

179
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,592
Yeah, she was there.
I couldn't believe it.

180
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,625
Boom, she was there.

181
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,694
You can't control who pops in.
She pops in.

182
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,706
She pops in?
Why didn't you pop her out?

183
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,867
I tried popping her out.
She wouldn't pop out.

184
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,537
- What, she insisted on staying?
- Not exactly.

185
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,068
"I want to be here
with you, Jeff"?

186
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,876
I couldn't pop her out,
I'm not in control of it.

187
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,645
Besides, my bench is thin.
I don't have a lot going on there.

188
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,584
Your bench is thin?
What, is she on your team now?

189
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,282
No, she's not on my team.
She popped in.

190
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,950
- What are you using my wife for?
- I thought you'd be flattered.

191
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,859
- Flattered? I'm fucking nauseous.
- Why are you nauseous?

192
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,090
It's... ugh!

193
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,530
You, my wife... I just
don't like the whole idea.

194
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,967
- It didn't really happen.
- I know, but it feels... in your mind.

195
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,700
- Okay.
- All right.

196
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,800
- Do me a favor, okay?
- What?

197
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,778
I don't want you using
my wife anymore for that, okay?

198
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,076
I'll never intentionally
use your wife for that.

199
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,515
- What do you mean?
- You can't control who pops in.

200
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,816
Yeah?
Okay, next time she pops in,

201
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,685
pick your pants up
and get out of the room.

202
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,427
Hello.

203
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,952
- How you doing?
- Very well, thank you.

204
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,965
Good.
How's the adoption coming? Good?

205
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,696
- Yes, it's going very well. Thank you.
- Great great great.

206
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,204
Wait till you get the kid.
It'll change your life.

207
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,174
"Get the kid"?

208
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,374
Mel will be with you
in just a second.

209
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,711
- You can go on back.
- Okay.

210
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,741
How are you doing?

211
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,316
- You're carrying on like a funeral.
- That's what it is to me.

212
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,952
It's a decision!

213
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,954
- Hey.
- Larry, Jeff, come in. Close the door.

214
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,934
Do you have any complaints?
I mean, how's it going for you?

215
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,236
I've got one tiny thing,
just one small issue.

216
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,607
I'm not happy with the toilet paper
in the rehearsal hall.

217
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,704
You're gonna get the softest,
most beautiful toilet paper.

218
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,910
You'll be so happy, you'll be hanging
around the toilet every day.

219
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,713
- You'll get me the softer rolls?
- You got it!

220
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,219
- All right!
- Mel, can we get

221
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,811
to why you asked
Larry to come here?

222
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,790
Oh, yeah, we have a little problem.
Yeah, right.

223
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,591
Ben Stiller is gone.

224
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,790
He is history.
He has left us.

225
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,927
He came to me and said,
"It's either me

226
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,698
or Larry David.
Make up your mind."

227
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,330
You know, I went right...

228
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,671
Larry David, Stiller out.

229
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,609
He complained about some things.
I don't know, minor stuff.

230
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,011
- You're kidding?
- No, we're not. Ben Stiller quit.

231
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,015
You wouldn't sit
in the front of a car?

232
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,779
You couldn't move
into the front of the car?

233
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,787
I have to move up to... we were two
minutes away from where we were going.

234
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,686
They were two minutes away
from where they were going!

235
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,988
At Ben Stiller's birthday party,
you didn't bring a present.

236
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,495
- He said no gifts.
- They always say no gift,

237
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,190
but everybody brings a gift.

238
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,564
So, you're at the show,
you won't shake his hand.

239
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,068
I happen to have
a small phobia

240
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,593
about shaking people's hands
who have snot on it.

241
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,503
- It's a small thing.
- Can you blame him?

242
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,906
At the party, everybody sang
"Happy Birthday" but you.

243
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,137
I don't like
the "Happy Birthday" song.

244
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,907
He never sings
the "Happy Birthday" song.

245
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,846
I don't like it either.
I hate the song!

246
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,715
It's a trite, cliché song.
I hate it.

247
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,844
Did you hear this thing
with the shish kabob?

248
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,912
You know about that?
That's painful.

249
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,185
- He's showing a stroke...
- It was an accident!

250
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:35,284
- Right into the kid's eye!
- Can I say something?

251
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,022
- Please.
- Mel?

252
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,655
Blessing in disguise.

253
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,098
He's a wonderful actor.
He's a fantastic actor.

254
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,863
I don't think he belongs
in musical comedy, frankly.

255
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,803
It's gonna work out,
it's gonna be fine.

256
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,466
- Everything will work out.
- All right.

257
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:51,203
So, uh, so you'll work on
the toilet paper thing?

258
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,870
Done, done.

259
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,903
Pink, blue, soft...
anything you want.

260
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,245
- You got it. I love you.
- I don't know about blue.

261
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,912
Listen, you know,
don't worry about Ben Stiller.

262
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:04,650
In my mind, I've got a couple
of wonderful people.

263
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,420
What do you think of...
do you know David Schwimmer?

264
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,360
- Sure, yeah, the guy from "Friends."
- Yeah.

265
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,363
Think about that guy.
Think about that.

266
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,797
He can move well,
sings well.

267
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,926
And we'd save a little money
on the marquee.

268
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,765
"Larry David Schwimmer,"
get it?

269
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,499
- Okay, bad joke.
- That's a good idea. I like that.

270
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,336
- Think about it.
- Bye, fellas, thank you.

271
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,365
- Okay, good to see you.
- Bye-bye.

272
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,037
God bless. Keep up
the good work.

273
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,775
Mel, Mel, you're making
a terrible mistake.

274
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,147
I'm telling you, there's
something wrong with this guy!

275
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,651
He's mentally
challenged.

276
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,178
There is something about
this middle-aged bald guy

277
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,282
that is thrilling!

278
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,895
Car wash! Car wash!

279
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,597
- Come on.
- We got one.

280
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,573
- Good, good, all right.
- $10.

281
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,803
- $10.
- Okay.

282
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,277
For the Langley Center.
It's a charity

283
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,644
and it's where
we all belong.

284
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,979
- Okay.
- $10.

285
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,814
- Here you go.
- $10.

286
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,878
Everybody's seeing
I'm putting it in my pocket, okay.

287
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,390
Nothing's coming off this.

288
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,767
Your foot's wet
and you're on...

289
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,862
- Oh, sorry.
- You're on the seat.

290
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,404
Could you close the door?
'Cause you're spraying it all inside.

291
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,382
- It looks pretty clean in here.
- Aw, it's dusty.

292
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,283
- Look, don't dump the-
- You're making a mess.

293
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,981
You're making it
a bigger mess than it was.

294
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,216
I think
it's okay now.

295
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,455
No, it ain't looking
like it's supposed to.

296
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,521
I guess I'll get going now.
That's okay.

297
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,726
No no, just give me
one more minute, okay?

298
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,007
Fuck!

299
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,552
Well, guess what?
I'm out of gas.

300
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,820
You left no gas
in the car.

301
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,054
How do you drive
around like that?

302
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,289
I don't know.

303
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,130
I'm nowhere near a gas station.
I gotta pee so bad.

304
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,260
You know what?

305
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,497
Where's my sunblock?

306
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,904
I'll bet you those guys
took my sunblock.

307
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,500
I was at a gas station,
'cause I got your car washed.

308
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,875
You know what?

309
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,348
I can't even talk. I have to go
to the bathroom so bad I'm dying.

310
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,373
All right, goodbye.

311
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,840
Hi, sir. I'm so sorry
to bother you.

312
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,437
I know this is gonna
sound a little crazy,

313
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,449
but my car
ran out of gas,

314
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,680
and I need
to use a bathroom.

315
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,381
- Is it possible just...
- No!

316
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,257
Would it be possible?
I can just get in for two minutes...

317
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,792
- Why would I let a stranger in?
- I'm not really a stranger.

318
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,827
I did the "Seinfeld" show,
I've done...

319
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,642
Hello, how are you?

320
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,307
You know, I was driving by
and I couldn't help but...

321
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,748
I beg you.

322
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,484
I'd like to make
an offer on your house.

323
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,253
10 bucks for a pee.

324
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,758
Oh my God.

325
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,430
May I help you?

326
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,497
My car is out of gas,

327
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,532
and I'm just desperate
to use a bathroom.

328
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,272
Come in, please come in.
Be my invited guest.

329
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,303
- You're kidding?
- Please come in.

330
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,872
- Please to come in.
- Oh my God.

331
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,442
Whoa!

332
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,420
Whoo!

333
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,888
Refreshed?

334
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,686
That was so nice of you
to do that.

335
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,215
And can I just say
something?

336
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,726
If you're ever
in my neighborhood

337
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,922
and you need to use
a toilet, I'm your guy.

338
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,363
- Oh, okay, I will remember this.
- All right.

339
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,799
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

340
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,599
- I hate to impose again.
- No no no.

341
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,127
You just did me
an enormous favor.

342
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,696
You got room
for another one?

343
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,368
- I am very curious.
- Really?

344
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,569
I need to get gas
for my car.

345
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,446
- I've got to walk to a station...
- Gas?

346
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,747
- Gasoline.
- I have a refinery in the back.

347
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,650
I'm joking!

348
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,053
I would be pleased
to take you to get gas!

349
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,557
That is unbelievable.
My wife left me with no gas.

350
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,560
- She does it all the time.
- Oh, you are married.

351
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,755
- Yes.
- That's a disappointment.

352
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,559
I thought maybe
I'd finally met someone.

353
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,123
- You don't have a man in your life?
- I don't.

354
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,896
We're a very
superficial people.

355
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,800
We like to know
what women look like,

356
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,635
so it's gonna be tough
for you when the...

357
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,197
Hmm.

358
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,869
What?
What is it?

359
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,174
I think I've got
a guy for you.

360
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,703
- A blind date?
- Literally.

361
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,579
All right, look,
I'll tell you what.

362
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,711
- We'll get some gas, okay?
- Of course.

363
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,586
- And I'll tell you all about him.
- I cannot wait.

364
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,682
- Hey, Haboos.
- Yeah?

365
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,786
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

366
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,854
I've worked up
a little appetite.

367
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,129
- You want to get a little lunch?
- Why not?

368
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,329
You ever had
delicatessen?

369
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,897
So this dog digs up a bra,
"Filling too much."

370
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,908
Oh Larry, that's funny.

371
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,035
- You like that?
- Yeah.

372
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,545
This place
is beautiful.

373
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,907
Hey, it's the guys
from the car wash.

374
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,218
Hey, guys.

375
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,982
- Hello.
- Remember me?

376
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,547
- The guy with the really clean car.
- Yeah.

377
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,786
- The blue car.
- The blue car.

378
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,988
You guys did a good job
on that car. Thank you.

379
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,122
- You're welcome.
- No problem. We had fun cleaning it.

380
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,359
- How did you do today?
- Pretty good.

381
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,426
- Yeah?
- We did good today.

382
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,166
- How much money did you make?
- We made $100. We had 10 cars.

383
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,573
Wow, pretty good.
Congratulations.

384
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,577
- Yeah, that's good.
- Good, good.

385
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,340
Hey, guys, let me
ask you a question.

386
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:37,143
Did you happen to see
any sunblock

387
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,912
on the passenger
seat in my car?

388
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,852
- I don't know.
- I didn't see any.

389
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,879
- You didn't see any?
- Never saw any sunblock at all.

390
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,551
- Is that right?
- No no.

391
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,925
- No, huh, didn't see any?
- No.

392
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,294
- I didn't see nothing.
- No?

393
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,798
I'll tell you
why I asked,

394
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,357
because there was some sunblock
when I drove in...

395
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,859
- No there wasn't.
- The sunblock was missing.

396
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,170
I didn't...
I didn't know that.

397
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:07,508
- I guess it's missing. Who knows?
- Yeah.

398
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,572
- We know nothing about sunblock.
- Okay, I was just...

399
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,141
You want to sit down and
have some food with us?

400
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,949
- It's really good.
- Sure, okay.

401
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,183
- This is my friend Haboos. I'm Larry.
- Oh, hello.

402
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:21,158
- Hello, I'm Stanley.
- Hello.

403
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,161
Now weren't there, um...

404
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,288
weren't there four of you?

405
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,027
- Uh, no, not recently.
- No.

406
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,535
No, at the car wash,
there were four of you.

407
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,097
No. Oh, you mean the guy
that was holding the card.

408
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,667
- There was four.
- Yeah, he must have gone home.

409
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,201
- He must have gone home?
- Or anywhere.

410
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,214
You don't know
if he went home or not?

411
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,375
- Um, I just...
- He might have gone home,

412
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,079
to go get ready for something.
I don't know what.

413
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,055
Huh, all right.

414
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,594
I think we know what
happened to the sunblock.

415
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,256
We lied!
Yeah, we lied to you!

416
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,929
It's really good
tuna salad.

417
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,435
It's good?

418
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,936
- You want some, Haboos?
- No no no.

419
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,734
- Oh my God.
- Oh.

420
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,231
Tunafish on your lap.
What are you gonna do?

421
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,336
- I don't mind...
- I'm gonna get this drycleaned for you.

422
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,041
- I can't do that, Larry.
- I'm gonna get it drycleaned for you.

423
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,607
- No, I don't mind.
- Haboos...

424
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,551
I insist. I'm gonna
dryclean it for you.

425
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,612
Okay, Larry.
Okay.

426
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,350
Eh, I'm so sorry.

427
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,857
Hey, I've got
a good joke.

428
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,793
An Arab, a Jew,
and an Asian fellow...

429
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,960
walk into a bar, okay?

430
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,335
I didn't tell the joke yet!
Wait till I tell the joke.

431
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,133
- I'm getting a corned beef on rye.
- Oh, yeah.

432
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,935
- A vino, a nice vino.
- Me too.

433
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,942
- Yeah.
- We'll have the same thing.

434
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,240
Say it again,
say it again!

435
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,596
So what's her name?

436
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,724
- Haboos.
- Hello, Haboos!

437
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,326
I mean, it's quite amazing
when you think about it.

438
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,633
- Nobody knows what she looks like okay?
- Yeah!

439
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,468
- Nobody.
- It's great.

440
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,371
Everybody's in
the same boat as you.

441
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,036
You have leveled
the playing field for me, Larry.

442
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,204
Nobody will ever know
what she looks like.

443
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,443
- Everybody's blind now.
- That's exactly what it is.

444
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:27,975
What an idea!
That's just great!

445
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,817
- Thank you.
- Just kind of fell in my lap.

446
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,322
Thank you.
Thank you...

447
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,085
- When can we do this?
- It just goes to show,

448
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,888
if you gotta pee,
knock on a door,

449
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,394
- you never know what could happen.
- I'm intrigued.

450
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,624
- Let's do it.
- By the way, I have to go with you,

451
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,929
- like as a chaperon thing.
- What?

452
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,993
Well, I'm sorry.
They require a chaperon.

453
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,267
- A chaperon.
- All right, so I'm gonna call her.

454
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,069
You know, there's
no downside here.

455
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,041
Really, there's none,
it's perfect.

456
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,737
It's perfect.
Call her up.

457
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,042
She's quite a Muslim.

458
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,042
Okay, tell me
when to stop.

459
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,311
Stop.

460
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,224
Why do you
do it so fast?

461
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,887
- Well, actually you were too fast.
- Oh, I was too fast?

462
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,488
Maybe I'm just not stopping
where you want me to stop.

463
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,759
- No.
- Yeah.

464
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,289
- No, really, no.
- I think so.

465
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,359
I think I got
a little something here.

466
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,666
You're stopping
on the card...

467
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,570
you know where the card is,
and that's...

468
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,938
when I say stop,
that's the trick, right?

469
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,567
- No.
- Is that the trick?

470
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,273
No, it's not.
This is your card.

471
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,147
Okay, ahem.

472
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,452
You listen to me,
Superman...

473
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,992
- I want that trick.
- No can do.

474
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,326
I apologize. I can't do anything.
You're not a magician.

475
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,306
- You're not a magician either, Stewart.
- Yeah, I am.

476
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,807
- No, you're not.
- Mmm-hmm.

477
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,310
'Cause you know one trick,
that makes you a magician?

478
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,778
That's not a magician.
One trick's not a magician.

479
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,940
Yeah, it is.

480
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,784
- You going trick or treating tonight?
- Mmm-hmm.

481
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,415
I'm taking half
that candy.

482
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,723
Don't say a word
to her.

483
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:20,357
You put it in the pantry,
I'll divide it up. Understand?

484
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,924
Okay.

485
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,833
- Okay?
- Yeah.

486
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,031
Now listen, I've got some friends
coming over this weekend

487
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,508
to watch the ballgame,
so be nice to them.

488
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,806
- Capisce?
- Capisce.

489
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:36,075
- Larry?
- Coming, honey.

490
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,443
- Is that leather or pleather?
- Vinyl,

491
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,715
and it's hot as hell.
I'm sweating like a...

492
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,154
- Well, you look good.
- Lar...

493
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,488
- Look at this!
- Happy Halloween.

494
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,551
- What do you think?
- Oh my God.

495
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,086
- Huh, is this great?
- Doesn't she look great?

496
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,463
Look at Andy Divine
over here.

497
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,698
Yes, I am, Sheriff.

498
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:02,070
- Now you look hot.
- Thank you, Susie.

499
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,974
What are you wearing?
What is this, no costume?

500
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,103
- No.
- Okay, you know what?

501
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,545
- What?
- I want you to change your costume.

502
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,310
- What?
- I don't like that costume.

503
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,146
- Why?
- I have my reasons.

504
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,847
- You got another costume?
- That costume is gorgeous.

505
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,286
- You're wrong.
- Thank you.

506
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,313
I've spent an hour
getting ready for this.

507
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,348
I don't have
anything else to wear.

508
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,554
Not so.
Excuse me.

509
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,790
I've got just
the thing.

510
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,628
You have the figure for that...

511
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,032
- I have the figure for that also.
- In your dreams.

512
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,730
Haboos's burka.
Just back from the drycleaners.

513
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,239
You're going
as an Islamic fundamentalist.

514
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,112
It's hot in this thing.

515
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,249
What the fuck?!
Hey, Osama,

516
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,482
go back to your own
fucking country.

517
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,234
Okay, you ready?

518
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,105
Yeah, I'm a little nervous,
but let's give it a shot.

519
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,768
I'm a little concerned
about the weather.

520
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,277
I got an umbrella.
It's all right.

521
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:16,474
- Okay.
- Okay.

522
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,506
Just be casual.

523
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,745
- Hello.
- Haboos, hello.

524
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,252
- Larry.
- Hi.

525
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,754
- Michael?
- This is Michael.

526
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,224
- I am indeed.
- You're beautiful.

527
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,386
- Oh...
- Look at this man.

528
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,952
- He's like your brother.
- He's a bald brother.

529
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,795
- I don't believe this.
- I've heard so much about you.

530
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,063
Larry has just sort of
praised you to the skies.

531
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,195
I've been raving.

532
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,501
Oh, well, I have
so few dates,

533
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,067
and tonight I have a date
with two handsome men.

534
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,577
Look, I got your
drycleaning.

535
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,603
Oh, Larry, you remembered.
Thank you so much.

536
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,946
Fixed your cloak.
I got the stains out of the cloak...

537
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,951
Thank you so much,
Larry. Thank you.

538
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,647
- and your hood and the whole outfit.
- I like the way she talks.

539
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,656
It's kind of
a sexy thing.

540
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,453
Did I tell you?
Did I tell you?

541
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,016
This is wonderful.

542
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,460
So what shall we do?
What shall we do?

543
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,964
Oh, Jeez, um,
whatever you like, Haboos.

544
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,966
What about a walk

545
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,494
or something, uh,
romantic, uh...

546
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,870
You got the drizzles.
It's drizzling. I don't know.

547
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,774
- Yeah, I think it's about to come down.
- I don't mind.

548
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,176
- You don't mind.
- You got a hood on. What do you care?

549
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,840
You know what?
I got an umbrella. We can take a walk.

550
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,248
It's like daredevil.
You're like daredevil.

551
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,149
Can't get this thing...

552
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,123
Oh!

553
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,285
- My veil!
- Ugh!

554
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,405
Not so hot, huh?

555
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,873
No, not so hot.

556
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,138
Well, ahem...

557
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:56,375
- thanks for trying.
- Yeah.

558
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,813
Please shuffle
the deck.

559
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,295
Thank you.
And...

560
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,298
this should be
your card.

561
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,732
Yeah, you peeked.

562
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,259
You bent it so
you could peek at it.

563
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,329
You looked at it
from behind.

564
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,204
How'd you know?

565
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,765
Anyone can
figure that out.

566
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,209
- Where's Larry?
- I don't know.

567
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,577
The game's
about to start.

568
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,605
Well, he's probably
in the bathroom.

569
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,169
Larry David.

570
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,553
Why don't you
close the door?

571
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,849
Well, we have some time
before the show.

572
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,422
I'd like to give you
your 10th-anniversary present.

573
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,574
- What are you doing?
- Who invited you?

574
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:35,204
- Get the hell out of here.
- Look at you! You are sick!

575
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,907
I want the other one.
Get out!

576
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,813
I'm the only one
here, baby.

577
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,681
And now for the rest
of your life,

578
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,846
you sick four-eyed
pervert fuck,

579
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,855
you're gonna be
fantasizing

580
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,754
about me
in this outfit.
