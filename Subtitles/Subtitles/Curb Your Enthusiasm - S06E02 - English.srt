3
00:00:14,603 --> 00:00:16,037
- Okay, fine.
- Let's go.

4
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:17,870
- Can I take a break?
- No!

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,603
- Why?
- Let's push through his.

6
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:22,104
Work it, come on, yeah,
so we can get this done.

7
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:24,736
This house feels
like a hotel to me.

8
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:26,837
- Hotel, really?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:29,703
She's right about that. It's
not as nice as the other house.

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,337
- I agree with you.
It's not as nice.

11
00:00:33,437 --> 00:00:37,237
Hi, Ted. I know.
No no, we're here.

12
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,770
We're in the middle
of it right now.

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,437
I know.
Can you believe it?

14
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:44,937
- You hear this?
- Hmm?

15
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:47,970
- She's talking to Ted Danson.
- That was a guy?

16
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:49,970
- Yeah.
- I thought it was a girl.

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,770
- No no, they have little chats on the cell phone.
- No, they don't.

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,204
- They do all day long.
- Really?

19
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,304
Yeah, I'm telling you,
it's unbelievable.

20
00:00:57,404 --> 00:01:00,204
And when they're together, she goes
like this. She gives him a slap.

21
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:02,170
- Touching like that?
- Yeah, like a playful slap.

22
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,537
- Oh, the flirtatious slap.
- The flirtatious tap.

23
00:01:04,636 --> 00:01:06,003
- Really?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,270
- That's like sex for platonic friends.
- Yeah.

25
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,137
Because they can't touch
each other, it's forbidden.

26
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,337
So they're allowed
to go like that.

27
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:16,437
- All right, I'm done
helping you move.

28
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:19,437
- Hey, thanks so much. Thank you.
- My pleasure.

29
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,237
- Are you going to the n.R.D.C. Opening tomorrow?
- Yeah yeah, of course.

30
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:23,670
You know, they're naming
a wing after me.

31
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,137
- Naming a wing?
- Yeah, I gave 'em a ton of money.

32
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:28,970
- Well, good for you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

33
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,770
- Larry, Larry David?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,037
Where's Loretta?
Loretta!

35
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:37,903
Peanut, peanut, boy!

36
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:39,903
Look at you, boy.
Baby girl!

37
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,970
Oh my God,
you all living large.

38
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,170
- What's up, sister?
- Boy, what you doing here?

39
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,003
What you doing here?

40
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:49,237
Uh-Oh, I knew I smelled
some cooking.

41
00:01:49,337 --> 00:01:52,170
Do I smell food?
Come here, auntie.

42
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:57,504
- Who is this guy?
- That's my brother Leon.

43
00:01:57,603 --> 00:02:01,037
What's up, girl?

44
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,803
Which room
he gonna stay in?

45
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,870
- What?
- Which room he gonna stay in?

46
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,137
- You can stay in my room, uncle Leon.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

47
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:09,636
- Let me get my bag.
- Show him where the room is at.

48
00:02:09,736 --> 00:02:11,736
All right.

49
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:14,471
Come on, boy!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

50
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:17,803
- Was he in the hurricane?
- No, he lives here in L.A.

51
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:24,736
Cheryl!

52
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,970
Boy, I don't know.

53
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,603
I wonder if cooking
good is hereditary.

54
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:34,070
You know what I mean?

55
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,537
Yeah, see, Loretta put
her foot in it this time.

56
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:38,703
Loretta put her foot
in it, turned it around,

57
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:42,003
And kicked you in your
own asshole. You feel me?

58
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:44,003
Watch your mouth
in front of the children.

59
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:47,003
Looks good, don't it,
don't it?

60
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:49,837
Man, oh, man, what are you trying
to do to your family with this food?

61
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,370
- You're gonna kill 'em.
- What you talking about, l.D.?

62
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:54,736
Come on, all that
cholesterol. It's no good for you.

63
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:57,603
Larry, can I talk
to you for a second?

64
00:02:57,703 --> 00:03:01,370
Really think about getting
rid of all the bacon

65
00:03:01,437 --> 00:03:03,337
And the sausage
and everything.

66
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:04,870
I'm gonna think
about eating it.

67
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,970
You crazy, girl!

68
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,003
I'm a little creeped out
right now.

69
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,670
Okay, I was just in Leon's room
putting some flowers in there.

70
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:21,003
- Leon's room?
- Yeah, and there's a...

71
00:03:21,104 --> 00:03:24,471
There's a stain
on the blanket.

72
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:28,471
- What kind of stain? What do you mean?
- Like when a guy...

73
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,937
You know, and does his
business, and he's alone.

74
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:33,703
It's so gross.

75
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:36,370
- Are you kidding?
- No.

76
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:38,837
Hey, everybody in the
family have them big ones.

77
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:42,170
- First night in our house?
- I know.

78
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,537
Okay,
I'm gonna talk to him.

79
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:47,870
- No, oh, God.
- What, are you kidding?

80
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:51,037
I don't want to some guy staying
here masturbating all over the place.

81
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,471
You can't talk
to him about it.

82
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,104
- Leon.
- Larry.

83
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:56,670
Can I talk
to you for a second?

84
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,937
Excuse me, ladies.
I shall return.

85
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:02,204
Oh my God. I gotta get
something over to...

86
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:04,736
All right.
Man, I'm about to bust.

87
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:08,003
- Enjoyed your breakfast?
- Larry, you know how to bring it.

88
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:10,170
- That's nice.
- I'm about to blow up.

89
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,703
- I just spoke to my wife.
- Okay.

90
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:16,370
And she said she was putting
some flowers in your room.

91
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:21,471
And she found a stain...

92
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:22,770
On your blanket.

93
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,304
Stain on my blanket, huh?

94
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:27,204
What, like juice,

95
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:29,204
Syrup, maybe syrup
or something like that?

96
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:31,537
Huh-Uh, no.

97
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:34,104
Gravies maybe, something
in the gravy category?

98
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:36,037
Huh-Uh, no.

99
00:04:36,104 --> 00:04:38,037
What kind of stain
was it?

100
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,170
- Hmm?
- Ejaculate.

101
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,937
E- What?

102
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:45,304
Ejaculate.

103
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:46,837
Ajackalit.

104
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:49,636
Not ajackalit.
Ejaculate.

105
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:52,537
Ejaculate?

106
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:57,370
Cum stain. Cum.

107
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:59,404
Cum stain.

108
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:01,937
What kind of cum
was, first of all?

109
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:03,670
What do you mean, what
kind of cum? Cum's cum.

110
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,204
- Cum is not cum, Larry.
- Cum's cum.

111
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:08,870
It couldn't have been mine. Know
why? 'Cause I gets mine, Larry.

112
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:10,870
I brings the ruckus
to the ladies.

113
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:13,404
Okay, so you're denying
this. Is that it?

114
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:15,404
First of all, look
around this place, man.

115
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:17,903
Are there any visuals
around here to Jack off to?

116
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:19,670
All we have
is basic cable, right?

117
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,736
What am I doing, jacking
off to "Andy griffith"?

118
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:23,471
Jacking off to clara,
huh?

119
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:25,937
- You mean aunt bea?
- Aunt bea, clara, whoever.

120
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:28,670
- Who's clara?
- Who's the lady who answer the phone?

121
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,204
- I don't know.
- Is that her name, clara?

122
00:05:31,304 --> 00:05:32,870
I don't know clara.
I know aunt bea.

123
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,770
Nobody wanna Jack off
to no damn aunt bea.

124
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,736
I don't remember any beauties
on that show, frankly.

125
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,304
It's not my cum,
Larry.

126
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,736
- Okay?
- Okay.

127
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,504
So, yeah, just get
the blanket clean.

128
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:49,870
- This is it?
- That's all, yeah.

129
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:52,636
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

130
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,204
You want me
to clean the blanket.

131
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:57,404
Yeah, so just throw it in
the bin. You don't need to...

132
00:05:57,504 --> 00:06:00,537
I don't have a bin, Larry. I have
to look at it to see what kind

133
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,137
- Of cleaning...
- You don't need to inspect it.

134
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,404
Larry, do you want me to
clean the blanket or not?

135
00:06:05,504 --> 00:06:07,970
What are you doing?
You throw it in.

136
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,437
Oh...

137
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,037
Okay, I had nothing
to do with that.

138
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:16,970
Sure, Larry,
whatever you say.

139
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:19,603
No, somebody's staying at my
house, and I'm sure he did that.

140
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,870
Larry, I could give a shit if it was
Santa Claus. I'm just trying to get it off.

141
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,670
No, I'm just telling you, okay,
that I had nothing to do with that.

142
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,603
- That's not my stain. All right, fine.
- Okay okay.

143
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:32,736
You look very cute
when you're all blushy.

144
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,070
- You think I'm gonna tell? I'm your friend, Larry.
- I didn't do it.

145
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,770
I'm not gonna lie
about that.

146
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,337
You're really insane,
you know?

147
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:43,504
Larry.

148
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,803
I don't see
my yankee Jersey...

149
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:49,803
- by the way.
- Huh.

150
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,504
- See that?
- Wow, it must be gone then.

151
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:55,337
I'm sorry, Larry.

152
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:57,037
What?

153
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:59,337
What? It happens, Larry.
That's what happens sometimes.

154
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:02,137
No no no, you don't understand.
That's Joe pepitone's Jersey.

155
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:05,337
I've had that Jersey since
I was a kid. Number 25.

156
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,903
It's gone. Somebody
else must have taken it.

157
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:11,803
Well, do you think
they'll return it?

158
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:14,636
Larry, in all the many
years I've worked here

159
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:17,104
At the dry cleaners, no
one ever returns anything.

160
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,003
Sometimes you get home and you
have something that isn't yours,

161
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:23,903
And sometimes something
of yours gets taken.

162
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:26,370
That's just the unwritten
law of dry cleaning.

163
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:28,070
Everyone knows that.

164
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,537
- Really?
- Really.

165
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:31,471
Well, I don't subscribe
to that law.

166
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:34,537
Oh, well, then maybe you
should change it.

167
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:37,370
- Maybe I will.
- Good.

168
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,003
I'll have your
semen-Covered blanket ready

169
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:42,137
On Wednesday.

170
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,571
So I confronted him.
Of course he denied it,

171
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,670
But I mean, come on,
give me a break.

172
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:55,670
He was in the room. I
mean, who else could it be?

173
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:57,670
You gotta kick him out,
hands down.

174
00:07:57,803 --> 00:07:59,537
First night
in the house.

175
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:01,937
Hey hey, I did it.

176
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:05,736
Come on,
no big deal.

177
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:07,170
You did it?

178
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,270
Yeah, did it,
yep, me.

179
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:12,537
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, what's the big deal?

180
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:14,104
What's the big deal?

181
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:15,537
It was passover
at your house.

182
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,937
I was drinking
a little bit,

183
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:19,471
Had some manischewitz,
you know?

184
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:22,137
Feeling good, and I
was away from the table.

185
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:25,003
I got an erection. I took
care of it before I came back.

186
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,204
I didn't want to come back to the
table with an erection at passover.

187
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:31,937
- Are you out of your mind?
- No, it's no big deal.

188
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:33,736
- Passover?
- It's not like yom kippur.

189
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:35,670
- I would never do it on the high holidays.
- He wouldn't do it

190
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:37,270
- On a high holiday.
- No, I wouldn't.

191
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,571
You're like a monkey.

192
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,571
- A monkey.
- You are.

193
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:42,937
- You didn't do a very good job of cleaning up.
- I did the best I could.

194
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:45,304
- That's the best you could?
- I had to get back to the table.

195
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:47,903
They were doing the four questions
and I love the four questions.

196
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:50,037
Gotta get back.
It's very important.

197
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:51,837
- I love the four questions.
- This is unbelievable.

198
00:08:51,937 --> 00:08:53,471
- No big deal.
- It is a big deal.

199
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:55,404
Come to my house and do it.
What do I give a shit?

200
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:56,937
Come on over and whack off.
Have a good time.

201
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:00,636
Oh, listen,

202
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:03,304
I left my sunglasses at your
house. I need 'em desperately.

203
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:06,404
- All right, I'll look for 'em.
- Don't let him in your house.

204
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,937
- Hi, guys.
- Hey!

205
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:10,937
- Look at you.
- No, look at you.

206
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:13,270
- You are miss nrdc.
- Look at you!

207
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,270
- Well, thank you.
- You make me wanna save the planet.

208
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,471
- So, should we go in,
- Okay, let's go in.

209
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:20,471
See the new wing?

210
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:22,504
Call me, actually. I have
something to tell you.

211
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,504
- I've got something to tell you, too.
- Oh, saying hello?

212
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:28,770
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

213
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,770
Why are you and Ted always kind
of hitting each other all the time?

214
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,404
All this playful hitting?
All that stuff?

215
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:39,736
It's not a conscious thing.
I don't know.

216
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:41,770
I'm expressive
with my hands.

217
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,304
Hey...

218
00:09:45,404 --> 00:09:47,670
Larry David. That's great.

219
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,037
- Never had a wing before.
- I know.

220
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:53,037
That's pretty good.
Pretty good.

221
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:56,870
- It's your night to shine.
- Yeah yeah, it's great.

222
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:06,304
What is that? "Wing
donated by anonymous."

223
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:09,137
- Yeah, yeah.
- Anonymous?

224
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,137
I'm not crazy about that.
Now it looks like...

225
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,471
Just looks like I did mine
for the credit

226
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:20,237
As opposed to, you know,
Mr. Wonderful "anonymous."

227
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:23,504
I know who it is.

228
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:27,204
It's Ted.

229
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:28,803
Ted is anonymous.

230
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:31,204
What are you,
kidding?

231
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:33,803
No, isn't that great?

232
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:37,437
He donated a whole wing and
didn't want anybody to know.

233
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,803
Well, he told you, so he
apparently wanted somebody to know.

234
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:43,070
He told me, okay?

235
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:45,437
Who else did he tell? How
do you know he just told you?

236
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:47,703
The point is that he didn't
need all the fanfare...

237
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:49,703
Fanfare? What fanfare?
I don't like the fanfare.

238
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:51,770
You're saying
I like fanfare?

239
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:54,404
He can tell a few people. He just
doesn't need the whole world to know

240
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:56,104
That he donated
all this money.

241
00:10:56,204 --> 00:10:58,137
You know what? I didn't need
the world to know, either.

242
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:01,237
Nobody told me that I could
be anonymous and tell people.

243
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:03,636
I would have taken
that option, okay?

244
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:06,903
You can't have it halfway. You're
either anonymous or you're not.

245
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,137
- What is it?
- People are pointing out

246
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,337
- There's Larry David's wing.
- Oh, yeah, there's Larry David,

247
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,603
The guy who has to have
his name up on the wall,

248
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,471
As opposed
to Mr. Anonymous,

249
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,037
But was really Ted.

250
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:19,337
- I'm proud of you.
- Anonymous.

251
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:21,770
It's fake philanthropy,
and it's faux anonymity.

252
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,970
What do you think
about that?

253
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:28,870
Oh, I want to go talk
to senator boxer.

254
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,070
I'll be right back.

255
00:11:31,204 --> 00:11:34,237
- Hi.
- Hi, Larry.

256
00:11:34,337 --> 00:11:36,736
- Hello, senator.
- It is good to see you.

257
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:39,670
Senator, I wanted
to talk to you

258
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,337
About an issue

259
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:45,070
That doesn't really get a
lot of play in the papers.

260
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,337
Well, tell me 'cause
I like new issues.

261
00:11:47,437 --> 00:11:50,537
Okay, I'm talking
about what's going on

262
00:11:50,636 --> 00:11:52,270
At the dry cleaners.

263
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,603
What's going on
at the dry cleaners, Larry?

264
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,237
Well, what happens is
sometimes they'll give your item

265
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:02,237
To someone else and
then that person owns it

266
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:05,504
And walks around in it,
and you have no recourse.

267
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:08,237
And there's no oversight.
It's just complete chaos

268
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:10,270
In the dry cleaning industry,
as I see it.

269
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,903
Larry, the thing
about it is

270
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:14,270
That sometimes
you get an item

271
00:12:14,437 --> 00:12:17,003
That isn't yours and
sometimes you lose an item.

272
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,803
So at the end of the
day, it balances out.

273
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:22,270
Yeah, well, it's not
balancing out for me, senator.

274
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,070
I never get an item,
and you know what?

275
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,070
If I got it,
I would return it,

276
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,870
Because I think the whole
system is flawed.

277
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,537
Larry, you see
these slacks?

278
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:34,037
See 'em?

279
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:36,404
Dry cleaners.

280
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:38,670
Those are
somebody else's pants?

281
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,903
Well,
they're mine now.

282
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,337
- You're part of the problem, senator.
- Please don't...

283
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:44,837
- isn't he great?
- Ted.

284
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:47,270
- Oh, you know each other, right.
- Oh, yeah.

285
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,270
You look fabulous!

286
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,270
You are such a hero.

287
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,471
- You are, Barbara.
- You know when you founded the oceans foundation,

288
00:12:53,537 --> 00:12:56,270
You changed everything because
his kids couldn't swim in the bay.

289
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,603
Oh oh, the poor
little kids.

290
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:01,636
They couldn't swim
in the bay.

291
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:04,370
Oh, what about the 400-Foot
pool they could swim in?

292
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:06,504
That wasn't available
to them at the time?

293
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:08,636
Well, you know,
could I just say,

294
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:11,437
That aside,
look at this.

295
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:14,870
Anonymous. You really...
I know. I know.

296
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,370
I didn't say...
Larry, did you know

297
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:19,070
This anonymous is Ted?

298
00:13:19,204 --> 00:13:22,003
- Yeah, I did.
- The point I want to make is:

299
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:23,471
You didn't need
to do this.

300
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:25,870
- That's true. He didn't.
- He didn't.

301
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,237
But that's why
I kept my name off,

302
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,471
Because I think
it's the exhibit.

303
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:32,736
It's the issue that needs
to stand forward, not me.

304
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,670
- And you're so passionate about the issue.
- Thank you.

305
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,137
You know,
too many people

306
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:38,636
Don't do things out
of the goodness...

307
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,137
They want the credit.

308
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,703
You are number one
in my book, Ted Danson.

309
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,670
- Senator.
- Please don't forget...

310
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,670
I've gotta run.
Bye, Larry. Bye, Ted.

311
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,204
- So sweet. Bye, darling.
- See you later.

312
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:49,603
- Yeah, bye.
- Right this way.

313
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,937
Wow, wow.

314
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:55,937
- I didn't expect that.
- What is this bullshit?

315
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:58,471
- What?
- Anonymous. Give me a break.

316
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,337
If you're anonymous, how
come people know about it?

317
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:02,204
I told maybe one
or two people,

318
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:04,770
Friends that I didn't think
I wanted to have a secret.

319
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,770
I have a feeling everybody
in this room knows.

320
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,504
Can I have your
attention, everybody?

321
00:14:09,603 --> 00:14:12,204
We're gonna start the ceremony and
senator Barbara boxer would like

322
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:15,037
- To say a few words.
- Thank you so much.

323
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:18,870
This is a night to thank
two very special people...

324
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:21,837
- you know, you're full of shit.
- You're a fucking asshole.

325
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:24,237
- So one is Larry David.
- Anonymous.

326
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:25,670
Larry David.

327
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,504
We are very thrilled
with his contribution,

328
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:33,237
- And the other is
anonymous.

329
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,337
So you know not
one person,

330
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:48,404
Not one thanked me
for the donation.

331
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:49,703
Are you aware of that?

332
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:53,337
Next time I give money
to anybody

333
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:55,903
It'll be anonymous,
I can tell you that.

334
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:58,504
And I'm going
to tell everybody.

335
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,803
I know who
the masturbator was.

336
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,703
Jeff.

337
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:10,603
Uh-Huh.

338
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:14,370
- Ted Danson told you that.
- It doesn't matter.

339
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:16,337
Oh my God. That's really unbelievable.

340
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:19,104
- You know what's unbelievable?
- That's unbelievable.

341
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,970
Is that your friend would
think that's it's okay

342
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,471
To come over to our house
and jerk off.

343
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:27,270
- He's had too much to drink, you know...
- Too much to drink?

344
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,770
- Yeah, he was drunk.
- Well I've had drinks before,

345
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:31,670
And I didn't go over
to somebody's house

346
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,304
- And masturbate in the guest room.
- Well, good for you.

347
00:15:34,404 --> 00:15:36,104
And by the way,

348
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:37,670
Jeff is banned
from our house.

349
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,803
- You're banning him from the house?
- Yeah.

350
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:42,736
He is not welcome
in our house anymore.

351
00:15:42,903 --> 00:15:44,270
I'd rather have

352
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,471
The masturbator in the
house than the gossiper.

353
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,104
Well, you obviously weren't
going to tell me, Larry.

354
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:52,370
I would have told you on the way home
or waited until I got in the house,

355
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:54,903
- Oh, right.
- So we'd have a good laugh over it later.

356
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:56,270
- A laugh?
- Well, whatever.

357
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,270
- Did you really think...
- No probably not.

358
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,537
That's hilarious... "Hey, Cheryl,
guess who jerked off on our blanket?

359
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,404
It was Jeff. Isn't
that hilarious?" Yeah.

360
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:07,204
Yeah, that's a fun ride home.

361
00:16:15,204 --> 00:16:16,937
Heya, what's going on?

362
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:18,404
Tch...

363
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:20,937
It's crazy, really, but,

364
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:23,803
I... You know.

365
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:25,736
Um...

366
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,571
Cheryl found out about
the stain on the blanket.

367
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:33,903
How could she find out?
You...

368
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:35,204
You didn't tell her.

369
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,802
No.

370
00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:38,304
Ted Danson?

371
00:16:38,404 --> 00:16:40,037
Yeah, her girlfriend Ted!

372
00:16:40,137 --> 00:16:42,670
- Why would he do do something like that?
- I don't know.

373
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,037
- That's unbelievable!
- I don't understand that!

374
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,571
- That was a private moment!
- Absolutely.

375
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,404
- And then he's gossiping?
- What a little yenta!

376
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:52,404
That's crazy!

377
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:54,636
Now how am I gonna
look Cheryl in the eye?

378
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:57,370
How can the four of us
ever go out again?

379
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,903
That's another thing.

380
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:03,636
She's uh... She was
pretty upset, and, uh...

381
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:07,903
She's banned you
from the house.

382
00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:11,970
- Cheryl banned me from your house?
- You're banned.

383
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:13,137
What the hell is going on?

384
00:17:13,237 --> 00:17:14,137
Oh, hey, suz'.

385
00:17:14,304 --> 00:17:15,471
- Larr'.
- Hi, how are you?

386
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:17,471
What do you mean Cheryl
banned you from the house?

387
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,937
- Who just said...?
- I heard you!

388
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:23,304
Don't try to bullshit me!
Why, what happened?

389
00:17:23,404 --> 00:17:25,137
What's gonna happen
if I don't tell?

390
00:17:25,237 --> 00:17:26,937
I'll call Cheryl
and find out.

391
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:31,304
- What the fuck difference does it make?
- Well, okay.

392
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:33,736
Last passover...

393
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:38,204
You what?!

394
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:40,370
You jerked off
in their house?

395
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:42,670
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is sick!

396
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,603
You have wrought your semen
outside our home, Jeff?

397
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:48,603
- Yeah.
- That's adultery!

398
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:51,204
- That's cheating on me!
- When did...

399
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:54,304
You masturbate in this house and
this house alone! Maybe a hotel.

400
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:55,937
Not at a friend's house!

401
00:17:56,037 --> 00:17:57,504
I have to agree
with her, really.

402
00:17:57,603 --> 00:17:59,204
You know what, Larry?
I can handle this.

403
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:00,736
He's my husband.
Shut the fuck up, okay?

404
00:18:00,837 --> 00:18:02,037
- Okay.
- It's sick, Jeff!

405
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:05,037
You don't jerk off
in somebody else's home!

406
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:06,504
And Cheryl kicked him out?

407
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:09,204
- Yeah, she banned him.
- Really?

408
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:12,137
Who the fuck is she to
tell my husband what to do?

409
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:14,571
- I punish my husband!
- I could not agree more with you.

410
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,437
- Thank you very much, Larry.
- You're right.

411
00:18:16,537 --> 00:18:18,237
Ban him from
the house?

412
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:20,703
- Fuck you, ban him from the house.
- Fuck you, yeah, absolutely.

413
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:22,603
I will take care
of you in my own way.

414
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:25,037
And you know what? Jeff
is banned from your house?

415
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,437
You are banned
from my house.

416
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:28,603
Get the fuck out!

417
00:18:28,703 --> 00:18:31,070
- What? What are you...
- Get the fuck out of my house!

418
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:33,337
Be gone with you!
Out!

419
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,237
If he's banned, you're banned!

420
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:37,337
- You're banning me?
- Yes, I am banning you.

421
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:39,571
- You're banning me from your house?
- Yes I am.

422
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,870
- Okay, fine. I'm banned!
- Good!

423
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,204
Don't come back!

424
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:45,504
Don't worry, I won't!

425
00:18:50,803 --> 00:18:53,903
- Boo!
- It's a ghost! Don't let him get me!

426
00:18:54,037 --> 00:18:56,504
What the hell's going
on here? Oh, hell no!

427
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,237
I will take you out!

428
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,870
The days are over where you
been terrorizing my people!

429
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,170
- It's me!
- Me who?

430
00:19:03,304 --> 00:19:06,803
Larry David! What are you
doing up under this klan sheet?

431
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,937
- What?
- Mm-Hmm.

432
00:19:09,037 --> 00:19:10,170
Oh my God, no no no.

433
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:12,137
- We were playing ghosts.
- Ghosts?

434
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:14,337
Where I come from, you
see somebody in a sheet,

435
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:16,504
Ghost is not the first
thing you think about.

436
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:18,204
You think about k.K.K.

437
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,070
- K.K.K.?
- Yeah.

438
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:22,404
Come on, are you kidding?

439
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:25,170
Scared me
half to death, Larry.

440
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,070
Okay, you can get off now.

441
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,970
- All right. Well, help me, love.
- Go ahead.

442
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:33,337
I'll get these groceries...

443
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:35,670
Hey, Jeff's sunglasses.

444
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:42,437
- Hey, Leon!
- What up?

445
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:44,837
What are you doing? You
want to take a ride with me?

446
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:47,837
I gotta return Jeff's
sunglasses. He left them here.

447
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:49,571
I got some stuff
to tell you anyway.

448
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:50,837
All right, Larry.
Hold on.

449
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,736
Give me two minutes, Larry.

450
00:19:57,137 --> 00:19:59,937
Ho ho ho! So it's
Jeff been jackin' off?

451
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:02,037
That's the
jackoff suspect, huh?

452
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:03,937
Yeah.
Leon, I am so sorry.

453
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,104
That's some fucked-Up shit
right there, man.

454
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,537
I know. I owe you one.

455
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:10,037
You damn right
you owe me one.

456
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,270
- Okay, so we're cool?
- We're cool, man.

457
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,003
Okay.
Hey, Leon...

458
00:20:15,104 --> 00:20:17,370
- you see that guy?
- That guy right there?

459
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:19,204
In the yankee Jersey.

460
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,670
Number 25... That's
my Jersey! Joe pepitone!

461
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,537
- What?
- The dry cleaner gave it to him.

462
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:24,636
He never gave it back.

463
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:26,304
That's some bullshit
right there.

464
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:29,003
- I'm going to handle this shit.
- What are you doing?

465
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:32,471
- I'm gonna get your shit back for you, man.
- What are you talking about?

466
00:20:32,603 --> 00:20:34,304
Be cool, Larry. I'm gonna
get that shit back for you.

467
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:36,571
Leon!

468
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:00,037
Yeah!

469
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:03,304
Yeah,
that's how I do it, baby!

470
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:05,603
Ha ha ha! Joe pepitone
up in this motherfucker.

471
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:07,137
Jesus.
Nice goin', man.

472
00:21:07,237 --> 00:21:09,037
- That's how I doos it, baby.
- Nice going.

473
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:12,571
- That's how I doos it, Larry.
- I like it.

474
00:21:18,504 --> 00:21:20,937
What do you want?

475
00:21:23,104 --> 00:21:26,137
Jeff's glasses.

476
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:27,571
Found them in my house.

477
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,903
He mentioned it to me
so I thought I'd return them.

478
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:31,670
All right, fine,
thank you.

479
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:35,537
- Um... I know I'm banned from the house and all...
- Yeah?

480
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,770
Think I could use
your bathroom?

481
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,337
No, a ban is a ban. What,
does my word mean nothing?

482
00:21:40,437 --> 00:21:41,970
I really gotta go.

483
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,471
All right, I will
temporarily lift the ban.

484
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:48,870
In out... Quick!

485
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,137
Beautiful.
Thank you.

486
00:21:50,237 --> 00:21:52,037
What the fuck?!

487
00:21:52,137 --> 00:21:53,870
Ow!

488
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,304
- It was a playful tap!
- What are you, nine years old

489
00:21:56,404 --> 00:21:59,404
In fourth grade? Get your
fuckin' hands off of me!

490
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:04,003
- It was a playful tap.
- Get in and out!

491
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,404
So what are we
gonna do now,

492
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:10,504
Get me a new blanket,
new bed, all that shit?

493
00:22:10,603 --> 00:22:12,037
Leon, I'm not
getting you a new bed.

494
00:22:12,137 --> 00:22:13,803
Come on, man.
That's crazy.

495
00:22:13,937 --> 00:22:15,304
That's crazy right there.

496
00:22:15,404 --> 00:22:17,870
- That mattress is tainted!
- Hey, wait a second.

497
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:21,504
Oh my God! There's another
Joe pepitone Jersey!

498
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:22,870
This is unbelievable.

499
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,970
Is it possible there's
two of these things?

500
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,703
- Can't be two.
- Let me check the size.

501
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,037
- 44.
- 44?

502
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:32,504
No, mine's 42.

503
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:35,304
This can't be my Jersey.
That's my Jersey.

504
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:38,970
Okay, well let's get the right
shirt then. How 'bout that?

505
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,670
All right, I can handle that
right now.

506
00:22:59,603 --> 00:23:01,237
That guy right there.
It's his shirt.

507
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:04,803
We're definitely taking
the damn shirt.

508
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,770
- Larry?
- Huh?

509
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,703
Larry David?
Hey hey hey.

510
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:10,237
Hey, it's merle...
merle berger

511
00:23:10,337 --> 00:23:12,337
From the n.R.D.C. Function
the other night.

512
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:14,870
Oh, merle!
Hey!

513
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,270
Hey, did you send that
guy over to take my Jersey?

514
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,703
Well, I didn't really
send him.

515
00:23:20,803 --> 00:23:22,636
He kind of went off
on his own.

516
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,337
He just took the Jersey
off my back!

517
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,437
I don't think it's really your
Jersey, though, is it, merle?

518
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:29,437
What do you mean?
I was wearing it.

519
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:31,903
Did you get that Jersey
from the dry cleaner?

520
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,070
Yeah, I got it...
I got it from the dry cleaner.

521
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,903
Okay, merle, that Jersey
is my Jersey.

522
00:23:37,037 --> 00:23:39,970
I brought it into that dry cleaner
and they gave it to you by mistake.

523
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:43,070
- But you didn't return it.
- Yeah, but that's the law of the dry cleaners.

524
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,937
You know, you win some,
you lose some.

525
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,070
- That's the way it works.
- That doesn't work out with me.

526
00:23:47,137 --> 00:23:48,803
I never get any stuff
from the dry cleaner.

527
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:50,636
The only mistakes they make with me
are to give my stuff to other people.

528
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:52,471
That's not my fault.
I've lost tons of stuff

529
00:23:52,537 --> 00:23:54,337
At the dry cleaners.
I lost drapes!

530
00:23:54,437 --> 00:23:56,870
Well, I'm sorry for your losses
but you're not gonna make it up now.

531
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,504
If you got a problem
with this

532
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:01,003
Why don't you just
write your congressperson?

533
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,337
Yeah, well I spoke to
senator boxer. How about that?

534
00:24:03,437 --> 00:24:05,270
Oh, that's great.
And what did she say?

535
00:24:06,437 --> 00:24:08,070
She said...

536
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,337
That she's gonna go to washington
and take care of this problem.

537
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:14,437
Okay, you know what?

538
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,170
I'm on the board at the n.R.D.C.

539
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,970
And your name's
coming off that wall.

540
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,170
How would you like that?

541
00:24:19,237 --> 00:24:21,070
You're gonna take my name off the wall?

542
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,370
- Yeah, I'm gonna...
- No! You wouldn't.

543
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:24,837
Oh, you bet I would.

544
00:24:24,937 --> 00:24:26,736
- Okay, go ahead, do it.
- I'm gonna do it!

545
00:24:26,837 --> 00:24:28,571
And why don't you put
up "anonymous" instead?

546
00:24:28,703 --> 00:24:30,537
I will.
That's a perfect idea.

547
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,803
- Yeah, really? Go ahead and do it.
- I have a lot of pull.

548
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:34,170
- Okay, let's see.
- Good.

549
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,603
You come by there
next Monday,

550
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:37,270
It's gonna say "anonymous"
on the wall.

551
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,437
- Okay, good! Don't forget.
- I'm not!

552
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:45,803
Okay.
Joe pepitone!

553
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,370
We got a matching set, man.

554
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,337
Mom!

555
00:24:56,437 --> 00:24:58,937
What's wrong,
sammy, darling?

556
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,803
Mmm! Bam!

557
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:05,937
Bam!

558
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,003
- War.
- War.

559
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:09,471
I declare war!

560
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:10,736
Boom! Aw!

561
00:25:10,837 --> 00:25:12,003
All right!
What'd I get?

562
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:13,837
Take it.
Peanut, grab that door!

563
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:15,736
Get the door, peanut!

564
00:25:15,837 --> 00:25:17,170
I just want to do
my thing, Larry.

565
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,837
What is your thing?

566
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,603
I'm gonna be
a director, man...

567
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:22,370
Action movies,
all that stuff, man.

568
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:24,537
You know you can't
just go right into that.

569
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:27,504
You gotta get something in
production, you know what I mean?

570
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:29,070
Oh. Oh, man.

571
00:25:30,304 --> 00:25:32,571
This is a new low,
even for you, Larry.

572
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,670
Huh?

573
00:25:33,803 --> 00:25:37,003
You came over yesterday,
you went to the bathroom

574
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:39,471
And you choked it
on sammy's teddy bear

575
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:43,471
As some kind of revenge
masturbatory payback!

576
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:46,571
- Okay, I didn't do that...
- Oh, bullshit! You're a fucking liar!

577
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:48,104
- What, I did that?
- Yes you did!

578
00:25:48,237 --> 00:25:49,104
Are you crazy?

579
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:50,670
It's that jackalit,
right?

580
00:25:50,736 --> 00:25:52,137
Who the fuck is this?

581
00:25:52,237 --> 00:25:53,770
That's Leon,
Loretta's brother.

582
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,937
What's up what's up,
what's up what's up? Mmm.

583
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:58,937
I like a woman with a
smart-Ass mouth like that.

584
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:01,571
- Yeah, well fuck you too!
- Mmm. You handle yourself.

585
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,770
That's beside the point,
Leon. This is sick,

586
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,870
This is perverse, and I think this
is the lowest you've ever gone.

587
00:26:07,037 --> 00:26:09,337
- Come on, I didn't do that.
- Oh really, then who did?

588
00:26:09,504 --> 00:26:12,237
- I don't know.
- Just some anonymous person?

589
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,803
Who's anonymous, then?

590
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:17,204
- Oh, I know who anonymous is.
- Who?

591
00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:19,770
- It's Ted Danson.
- How do you know?

592
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,070
Well, he told me, but he
told me not to tell anybody.

593
00:26:22,204 --> 00:26:25,237
That's how he likes to do it.
Makes him feel better about himself.

594
00:26:26,237 --> 00:26:27,603
Danson?!

595
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:29,404
Oh, that's disgusting!

596
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,970
That is just disgusting!

597
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:34,237
What a perv, man!
Actors!

598
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:37,270
Boom! War.

599
00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:39,404
I declare...

600
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:40,537
- boom!
- ... War.

601
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:48,504
I'll get it.

602
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,204
Ted, it's suzie for you.

603
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:05,304
I wonder what she wants.

604
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:13,170
- Hey, Larr, how are you?
- Hi kathy.

605
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,037
- How are you doing, man?
- Good.

606
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:18,703
Hey, I wanted to tell you I heard that
you took your name off the nrdc building

607
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,970
And had it replaced
with anonymous.

608
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,603
I think it's so wonderful.
I admire you so much for that.

609
00:27:24,703 --> 00:27:28,603
Kathy, I get plenty of fanfare. I
don't need the fanfare, you know?

610
00:27:28,703 --> 00:27:30,504
- Good for you, Larry.
- I really don't.

611
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:32,603
As a matter of fact,
I hope you don't mind

612
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:36,137
That I told a few people that
you were the anonymous person.

613
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:38,703
I hope that's okay
that I let that slip out.

614
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,337
Well, I can't really tell you
what to do, but I... Yeah...

615
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:43,370
People should know
you're anonymous.

616
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:46,437
- You're a great guy, Larry...
- Well, if you want to tell people go ahead.

617
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:49,471
- You know, it's up to you.
- I have already and I might continue.

618
00:27:49,603 --> 00:27:51,636
- Continue away.
- All right, I will.

619
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,070
- Thank you.
- Take care, honey.

620
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,370
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

621
00:27:54,504 --> 00:27:57,270
It's that guy. That's the guy.

622
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,170
Hey!
That's the guy!

623
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,636
That's that bald guy
that took my Jersey!

624
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,870
You gotta let me in!

625
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,270
These people
are chasing me!

626
00:28:39,437 --> 00:28:41,504
Sir, the building's closed.
I can't help you.

627
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,703
No no, I'm Larry David.
That's my wing!

628
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:46,903
- That says "anonymous."
- I'm anonymous!

629
00:28:47,003 --> 00:28:48,270
I'm anonymous!

630
00:28:48,337 --> 00:28:50,437
I'm
anonymous!

631
00:28:50,537 --> 00:28:53,104
Larry David IS ANONYMOUS!
