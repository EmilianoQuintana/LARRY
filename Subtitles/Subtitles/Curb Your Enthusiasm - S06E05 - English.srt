00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:22,317
Oh my god!

4
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,650
- Are you ready to go?
- Oh, god, look at this.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,750
Look at that.

6
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:30,383
- What is this?
- It's a book about freaks.

7
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:32,417
- Is this Ted's gift?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,383
- That's what you're giving him for his birthday?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:37,083
- Okay, yeah.
- It's unbelievable.

10
00:00:37,217 --> 00:00:40,684
Hey, guess what. It's all
finalized-- the cemetery plots.

11
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:43,484
We got 'em, so now Ted and
Mary are gonna be next to us

12
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:45,150
- and Jeff and Susie.
- Hey, you like her?

13
00:00:45,283 --> 00:00:46,317
I see that.

14
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:48,217
I think we really overpaid
for those plots.

15
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:50,851
- It's too late, and it's a beautiful site.

16
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,383
Hold on. This has
to be the car service.

17
00:00:53,484 --> 00:00:55,951
- Hi, good evening, Miss david?
- Yes.

18
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,951
- Your car's here.
- Thank you. We'll be right out.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,584
- We'll be right out. Thank you so much.
- Okay.

20
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:04,383
- Oh, oh, jesus! Oh, jesus!
- Larry, our car's here.

21
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:06,650
- Okay.
- This isn't for you, actually.

22
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,083
Look at the size
of this guy.

23
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:10,584
Let's put it away.
We're going to a party.

24
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,317
We have a car. We can drink.
We can have margaritas.

25
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:15,417
We can hang out,
be normal.

26
00:01:15,517 --> 00:01:18,150
Great idea, the car service, great idea.

27
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:26,317
Okay, so we'll just call
you in a few hours or so.

28
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:29,317
Good. We'll see you in a while.
Have a great night, folks.

29
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:32,150
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna be here.

30
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,951
- Got something to read?
- No no no, I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Take care.

31
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,750
All right.

32
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:40,684
No book? No paper?

33
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:43,283
- Nothing? A puzzle, huh?
- No, I--

34
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:46,217
You folks have a great night,
though. Have a great party.

35
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:48,417
I don't have to worry about
you in there? You'll be okay?

36
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:50,417
- I'm great.
- Okay, fine.

37
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:53,617
I'll be right here when you
get out and have a great party.

38
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:55,050
- Okay.
- Thank you.

39
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:57,584
I couldn't be alone with
myself for 15 minutes.

40
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:58,951
My brains would melt.

41
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,684
He's gonna sit here for three
hours and not gonna read.

42
00:02:01,784 --> 00:02:05,217
No lady or nothing.
No distractions.

43
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:10,150
The cemetery plots
came through.

44
00:02:10,283 --> 00:02:13,383
So it's Jeff and Susie and
you and Cheryl and me and Ted

45
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:15,217
buried next to each
other forever. Oh my god.

46
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,550
Yeah, right.
Isn't that something?

47
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,283
- Yeah.
- That's really something.

48
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:20,317
- Yeah, I don't want--
Not too soon. - yeah, no.

49
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:23,317
It's true. When you
start to think about it,

50
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:25,517
somebody's gotta
go first, I guess.

51
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:29,150
Well, it's not gonna be me and
probably not Ted. We're very healthy.

52
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,983
- Really?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:33,250
- Nice party, huh?
- This is very nice.

54
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,983
- I don't even recognize most of these people.
- Really?

55
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,617
You know the rizmans.

56
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,617
Yeah yeah, I'm not
that crazy about them,

57
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:41,884
frankly, you know.

58
00:02:42,016 --> 00:02:44,116
You don't like
arnie rizman?

59
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:46,851
Just 'cause the person's bald
doesn't mean I have to like them.

60
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,784
Okay, forget it. I'm sure there's
someone here that you like.

61
00:02:49,884 --> 00:02:51,784
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- Okay, enjoy yourself.

62
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:53,050
All right, okay.

63
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,450
- Good evening.
- Good evening to you.

64
00:02:56,517 --> 00:02:59,717
- How you doing?
- I am doing...

65
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:02,150
Pretty good.

66
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,350
Pretty, pretty good.

67
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,517
- What can I get you?
- You got a little bow tie there, huh?

68
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:09,083
Got a little bow tie.

69
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,217
That's your idea?

70
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,851
No. No, it's not.

71
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:18,050
You know, we're asked
to wear it sometimes.

72
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,983
- What do you mean sometimes? -
Well, we're given a work-order form

73
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,851
with a special request, and in
this case, there was a request

74
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:27,050
from Mr. Danson
to wear the bow tie.

75
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,450
- You're kidding.
- No.

76
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,250
Ted danson specifically
requested that you wear a bow tie?

77
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,884
Are you joking?

78
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:37,417
To distinguish,
I believe,

79
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:41,417
between the guests
and the staff.

80
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:44,183
Well, looks like I'm gonna
have to have a little talk

81
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:46,684
with Mr. Danson.

82
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:48,450
No no no no,
that's totally--

83
00:03:48,517 --> 00:03:50,250
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

84
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,851
- I wanna say a little something to him.
- Please, please don't.

85
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:53,684
- I feel like I have to.
- You don't. You don't.

86
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:55,717
- Honestly, it's-- - I do.
I really do. This is wrong.

87
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:57,617
- It's just wrong.
- It's unnecessary.

88
00:03:57,717 --> 00:04:00,517
We're asked sometimes. It's
fine. It's part of the job.

89
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:01,917
Listen, I'm doing this
for you.

90
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,550
Well, if you're doing
it for me, then don't.

91
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:06,917
- Please.
- Okay, I'm doing it for me.

92
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:08,550
Also, please
don't then.

93
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,083
You don't understand
how I operate, okay?

94
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,550
- Maybe not, but-- - I
will not get you in trouble.

95
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:15,684
I'll talk to him.
Everything will be fine.

96
00:04:15,784 --> 00:04:19,350
It would probably implicate me in
some way, and it's not that important.

97
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,983
- What's your name?
- Jamie.

98
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,350
- Jamie, okay.
- Yeah.

99
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,584
- Jamie, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

100
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:26,717
I'm gonna go say a little
something to Mr. Danson.

101
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:28,150
Please don't--

102
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,450
In a few minutes, you're not
gonna be wearing a bow tie.

103
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,884
I don't mind wearing it that
much. I'd rather you don't.

104
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:35,750
You're gonna say, "Larry, thank
you for getting rid of my bow tie."

105
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,817
I thank you, Larry, to not
say anything to Mr. Danson.

106
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:42,450
Jamie, I gotta
say something.

107
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,517
You don't.

108
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,183
- I have to. I couldn't live with myself.
- You don't have to.

109
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:49,350
Just trust me. I know
how to talk to people.

110
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,983
- I do trust you, but please don't.
- That's gotta go.

111
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,417
- That's gotta go, jamie.
- It doesn't have to.

112
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,983
- Please, please.
- Nah-ah-ah.

113
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:01,350
- Hey, happy birthday!
- Hey.

114
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,484
Yeah, yeah, I'd hug you,
but I know you got a phobia.

115
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,584
Yeah, we don't need to
go that far, you know?

116
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:08,817
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah.

117
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,116
Why'd you make
this poor kid

118
00:05:10,183 --> 00:05:13,383
- wear a bow tie? Bartender?

119
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:15,383
Got him in a bow
tie? What's up with that?

120
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:18,450
We had a choice. No bow tie,
bow tie. We went with bow tie.

121
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,383
- Classes up the party a little bit, I think.
- Really?

122
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:24,183
Makes me a little uncomfortable
seeing a guy like that,

123
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,383
have to stand there, wear
a bow tie the whole night.

124
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,784
- That's not cool.
- It looks elegant.

125
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:31,450
Feel like you're putting on
airs or something, you know?

126
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,650
- I'm putting on airs?
- A little bit, yeah.

127
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,650
You know, what is it?
So you feel good?

128
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:37,617
He's gotta feel bad
so you can feel good?

129
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:39,383
Is that how the world
works for you?

130
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:41,851
- Did he say something to you?
- No, he didn't.

131
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:43,383
- He did, didn't he?
- No, he did not.

132
00:05:43,484 --> 00:05:46,116
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.

133
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:48,484
- Bullshit.
- He said he'd rather I wouldn't talk to you,

134
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:49,917
that's what
he said, but...

135
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,383
- Can't take the bow tie off?
- No.

136
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,750
- That's your final answer?
- That's my final answer.

137
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:55,750
- Final answer?
- Yeah, no deal.

138
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:57,484
Pfft! Whatever
you want, you know?

139
00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:59,550
- Come on, Larry, please.
- Okay, all right.

140
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,484
I feel like a jerk 'cause
I kind of promised him.

141
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:05,450
Well, too bad. Go back
and say you failed.

142
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,650
Okay, I will.
One more thing:

143
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:10,617
I got a driver
out there.

144
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:12,650
I was wondering if I could
bring him in the house.

145
00:06:12,784 --> 00:06:16,283
He's sitting out there. He'll
be out there for three hours.

146
00:06:16,383 --> 00:06:18,283
Do you mind
if I bring him in?

147
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:20,383
Why don't we just send
some coffee out to him?

148
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:23,116
Send coffee out to him?
Come on, what is that?

149
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,016
Let me bring him in. He'll sit in
a corner. He won't bother anybody.

150
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:28,383
It's his job to sit in the car
and wait while you have fun.

151
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:30,450
I know it's his job,
but listen, I used to drive.

152
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,584
I know how it feels to sit
in a car for three hours

153
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:36,016
and do nothing and freeze and
not be able to put the radio on

154
00:06:36,183 --> 00:06:38,851
or the lights. You can't read.
There's nothing you can do.

155
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:41,016
- You drove limos?
- Yeah, I did drive limos.

156
00:06:41,116 --> 00:06:42,650
- Really?
- Yeah.

157
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,750
- Did you wear a little bow tie?
- No, I did not.

158
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:46,784
The woman was blind
and couldn't see.

159
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,584
- Really?
- Yeah.

160
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:50,584
I didn't even
wear the uniform.

161
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:52,417
- Really?
- Yeah, she couldn't see a thing.

162
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,750
The car was filthy, but

Bring him in. I don't

181
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,951
That doesn't affect
heterosexuals, right?

182
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:46,951
- What are you doing?
- The guy's impossible.

183
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:49,083

184
00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:51,116
It's a joke, people.
It's a joke, come on.

185
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:54,383
- Okay.
- I'm not sure.

00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:57,083
What is that? Oh, that's mine. Hey!

00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,983

- That's it, yeah.

188
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,717
- "Mondo..."
- "Mondo freaks."

189
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:03,884
"Mondo freaks."

190
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,617
Leaf through it.

191
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,983
Huh?
Are you loving that?

192
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,183
Well, thank you, Larry.
Thank you very much.

193
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,350
You're welcome. It's a
great coffee-table book.

194
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,983
Oh, yeah, wait.

195
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,717
I wanna just show it
to Jeff, okay?

196
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:24,584
Yeah, thanks.

197
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:27,550
All right, what have
we got next here?

198
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,016
I'll be right back.

199
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,083
Okay--

200
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:47,083
- It's pete peterson.
- All right, what have we got here?

201
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:50,584
That's unbelievable.

202
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:53,183
- What do we got here?

203
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,350
His head tilted!

204
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,484
Oh!

205
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,283
You all right, buddy?

206
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:07,917
Happy birthday, becker.

207
00:09:13,283 --> 00:09:15,450
Oh, jesus.

208
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:20,550
I'm sorry about that.
Who is he?

209
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,016
Does anyone know?

210
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,517
- I think that's my driver.
- That's your driver?

211
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:28,383
This is the guy you
brought into my house?

212
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,684
- I'm sorry, man.
- You're sorry? That guy's plastered.

213
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:35,116
- It was an accident. He didn't do it on purpose.
- Get off me!

214
00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:36,851
God, get--

215
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:39,450
Get out of here,
you stupid creep!

216
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,183
What happened?

217
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:45,083
- That guy, the drunk guy, just groped me.
- He what?

218
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:48,083
He just-- ooh!
Put his hands all over me.

219
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:49,550
- I don't believe him.
- That son of a...

220
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,250
You know something?
You're out of here. Go on.

221
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,884
- What?
- Go on, get out of here, Larry.

222
00:09:53,983 --> 00:09:55,917
- What?
- Get the hell out of my house, will you?

223
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:59,016
- What? It was an accident.
- Take your freaky friend

224
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,784
- and your freak book and get the hell out.
- What?

225
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:04,784
He gropes my wife, and he
breaks-- I can't believe this!

226
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:06,484
- Fine, fine, I'm leaving!
- Go on.

227
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:09,283
Fine. Happy birthday.
Come on, Cheryl.

228
00:10:09,383 --> 00:10:11,750
- I'm sorry.
- Oh Cheryl, it's not your fault.

229
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:13,283
Happy birthday.

230
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:15,484
- That was a bullshit party.
- Yeah.

231
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:17,750
Let's get out of here. Get in.

232
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,350
- No, you're not driving.
- I'm totally fine.

233
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,817
- Are you crazy? You're not driving.
- I'm not that drunk.

234
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,283
- What are you doing?
- Hey, I know.

235
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,983
I'm just joking around.
But seriously,

236
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,484
you two, get in.
I'm driving.

237
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,550
No, you're not. You
can't drive. You're drunk.

238
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,083
You are not gonna drive us
home. Nobody in their right mind

239
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:34,750
- would get in a car with you right now.
- Come on, get in the car.

240
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:36,750
- You'll stay right over here.
- Okay okay okay.

241
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:38,383
Don't forget me, bud.

242
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:40,417
- Do you know how to drive a limo?
- I don't know.

243
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,684
- Hey, charlie.
- Stay out of the glove compartment.

244
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:44,750
- Charlie.
- Stay out of the glove compartment.

245
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:46,484
Get...

246
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,383
Come on, charlie.
Come on, get up.

247
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:04,917
- No kidding?
- Let's go.

248
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:07,116
Oh, man.

249
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:09,283
Oh, my goodness.

250
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,750
There she is.

251
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,584
Come on, step,
step, come on.

252
00:11:18,684 --> 00:11:22,584
Honey, honey...!

253
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:25,183
- Nobody's home. Stay out.
- Come on, baby.

254
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:28,016
No, not again.
God damn you!

255
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:29,584
Huh-uh, huh-uh.
Who are you?

256
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:32,217
Get off! Get off!

257
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,450
Don't you dare get on that
couch. Hey, what are you doing?

258
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,484
Huh? You party
with this fuckface?

259
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:38,750
No, we weren't partying.

260
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:40,584
No, he was driving us.

261
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:43,851
And he had too much to
drink, so we thought...

262
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,283
You!

263
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:48,951
Get your stinky,
nasty feet off my couch.

264
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:52,050
Who's there? Is that the goddamn
neighbors with their fucking dog?

265
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,217
- No, dad, go to bed!
- Who's there?

266
00:11:55,317 --> 00:11:57,684
This is the shitstorm
of my life. It's shit.

267
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,050
Yeah, it doesn't
look that great.

268
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,851
No, it isn't.
Aren't you pretty?

269
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:04,584
- Don't you look nice?
- You're pretty.

270
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:06,116
- You're pretty.
- Very attractive.

271
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:08,784
- Tell 'em to stop playing the music.
- Shut up!

272
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:11,484
We have no way to get
home tonight because--

273
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:13,050
No, clearly
he can't drive.

274
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,851
I would offer you the upstairs
room, but my dad is a fucking mess.

275
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:17,050
Can we take
the limo home?

276
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:18,750
I'll bring it back
tomorrow. I promise.

277
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:20,484
You gotta
bring it back, man.

278
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:22,350
I don't need you to talk!

279
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:24,784
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry I couldn't invite you in for a snack.

280
00:12:24,884 --> 00:12:27,050
But you know what? There's
nothing in the cupboard.

281
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,016
- I don't want that dog shitting in my yard!
- Daddy, so help me!

282
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,517
This is gonna be so fun.

283
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:35,517
I'm so looking forward
to this concert.

284
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,383
Oh, my gosh,
you're wearing a suit.

285
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:39,150
This is like
a real date.

286
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,851
Gonna go to dinner and go
to a concert and hang out.

287
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:43,951
Oh my god.
You know what I heard?

288
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,150
I heard that heather mills
and paul mccartney

289
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:48,217
might be getting
back together.

290
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:50,217
- Oh, how exciting.
- Can you believe that?

291
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:52,951
- I'm a all atwitter.
- She might even be there tonight.

292
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,083
- Really?
- Yeah. See heather mills.

293
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,350
You know,
I gotta tell ya,

294
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:01,250
- I'm thinking about this Ted danson thing.
- Yeah.

295
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:04,784
I don't think I wanna be
buried next to this guy.

296
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,617
That's how I feel.

297
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,050
So I was thinking
maybe...

298
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:12,750
Maybe you'll switch plots with
me, so you'll be between us.

299
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:14,851
I don't care.

300
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:17,016
But you know that means that
you'll be next to Susie.

301
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:19,484
So you're gonna need
her permission.

302
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:21,584
- I don't care what you do.

303
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:24,050
Oh, hey, that's them.

304
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,951
Oh, I'll get it.

305
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:31,083
- Paul McCartney, baby, yeah!
- Paul McCartney!

306
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:34,450
Hey, guys. Hey, you look
great. Oh, look, a suit too.

307
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:37,217
- I know. Isn't that nice?
- Yeah, you do look good.

308
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,983
- I love this outfit.
- You do?

309
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,584
Oh, yeah, it's great-- the
pink. I love this stuff.

310
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:43,417
Wow, glad you like it.

311
00:13:43,517 --> 00:13:45,717
- Really nice, yeah.
- It's a rock star thing.

312
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:48,550
- Great combo. Yeah, looks terrific.
- Glad you like it.

313
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:51,617
- You want some wine, cheese?
- I'd love some wine. That'd be great.

314
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,983
Where's the freak book?

315
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:56,317
- Left it in the car.
- Oh, man, all right.

316
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,750
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

317
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:00,417
How about a toast? To good
friends, good friendship.

318
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:04,183
- Nice, very nice, very nice.
- To friendship?

319
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,283
You know, you weren't
there last night.

320
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:08,584
- No, I heard.
- Ted danson,

321
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,283
I have had it
with this guy.

322
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,116
- He's a little pompous lately, I notice.
- So full of himself.

323
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:16,484
Let me just say this, okay? I don't
wanna be buried next to this guy.

324
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,283
I really don't. I've
been thinking about it.

325
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:19,884
I was talking to Cheryl,
and I asked Cheryl

326
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:22,116
if she'd switch plots
with me, and she agreed.

327
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,750
- So now I'll be buried next to you.
- Next to me?

328
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:26,550
Yeah, next to you,
so that's that.

329
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,450
I don't really like that,
lar. I don't like that.

330
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,517
- Why not?
- Because I liked it the way it was.

331
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:33,383
What's the big deal?

332
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:35,750
Because, Larry, honestly, I don't
wanna be next to you for eternity.

333
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,283
May I be so bold?

334
00:14:37,383 --> 00:14:39,484
Your best self emerges
after you're dead.

335
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:42,016
- You don't know that for a fact.
- I do know. I came back.

336
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:45,750
Guess what. Even your best self,
I'm not interested for eternity.

337
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,350
I take back my toast.

338
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,650
- Good friends?
- Fine, take back your toast.

339
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,083
I take back the toast, and I take
back what I said about your outfit.

340
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:56,550
Well, you only said it
'cause you had this in mind

341
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,750
to get me to switch plots.
There's always an ulterior motive.

342
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:00,817
If you were married to me, I never would
have let you out of the house with that.

343
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,250
That's fine.
I'm not married to you.

344
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,717
And I'm not gonna be next to
you forever and ever and ever.

345
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,517
- I want some peace and quiet.
- Okay, fine.

346
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,584
How about this?
I'll switch with Cheryl,

347
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:11,584
but then you switch
with Jeff.

348
00:15:11,684 --> 00:15:13,684
- I can't do that. I need to be on the end.
- That's true.

349
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:16,951
I'm claustrophobic. I
can't be anywhere but the end.

350
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,951
He hyperventilates.
He has to be on the end.

351
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,584
- Yeah, it's not good.
- I'll tell you what's not good, okay?

352
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,784
The selfishness
that's going on here.

353
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:26,951
No, I wanna be next to my goddamn
husband for eternity, not Ted danson.

354
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,484
- That's the way we lay there. I made a vow to him, Larry.
- Okay, fine, we're leaving.

355
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:33,350
We're leaving this cemetery.
We're getting another plot.

356
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,183
- No, we're not. No, we are not.
- Yes, we are! Yes, we are!

357
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:38,016
Nobody's switching? Is that
what you're saying to me?

358
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:39,817
We should keep it
the way it is.

359
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:43,317
You're gonna keep it the way it is?
Fine, fine. Enjoy your evening, okay?

360
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,217
- What are you talking about?
- I'm going. I'm going.

361
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:48,217
You don't wanna be buried
next to me when you're dead,

362
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:50,784
I can assume you don't wanna
be next to me when you're alive.

363
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,016
I'll see you
at the concert.

364
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:55,917
- He's a drama queen. He's overreacting.
- I don't know.

365
00:15:56,016 --> 00:15:58,383
Like a little girl. What was
that? That was nothing.

366
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:00,417
- Where's the car?
- Leon took it.

367
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,750
He didn't ask me.

368
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:05,951
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking the limo.

369
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,951
- Limo?
- He's out of his mind.

370
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:10,016
He's driving a limo?

371
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,684
Oh, fuck!

372
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,851
- Hello.
- Larry, hey, it's charlie, the limo driver.

373
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:58,617
- Hello, charlie.
- I'm sorry about last night.

374
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,684
Yeah, boy oh boy,
you should be.

375
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:03,684
- You shouldn't have had to go through that.
- Yeah, that was pretty bad.

376
00:17:03,784 --> 00:17:06,884
I didn't mean to get that
drunk. I just got out of hand.

377
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:09,884
I did you a favor. I let you in
the house. It was pretty awful.

378
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:12,917
I'm so-- I'm so--
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.

379
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:15,217
Guess what. I'm in the limo right
now. Do you want me to return it?

380
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:17,317
Look, man,
you gotta do me a huge favor.

381
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,317
I gotta pick somebody up
in 30 minutes at the airport.

382
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:22,983
He's this huge vip client,
and I can't get there, man.

383
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,584
They just called.
You gotta go pick him up.

384
00:17:24,684 --> 00:17:27,450
- What are you, kidding me?
- No, please, seriously.

385
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:29,617
I'm not gonna go pick
somebody up at the airport.

386
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,717
If I don't get this,
I lose my job, man.

387
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,617
And my wife is
gonna lose her health care.

388
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:35,983
We're gonna lose everything,
man. The house goes too.

389
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,884
I can't pick somebody up
at the airport.

390
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:40,750
- Are you insane?
- Larry, do me a favor. Come on, man.

391
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:42,983
- Oh, jesus.
- Please, Larry,

392
00:17:43,116 --> 00:17:44,684
for god's sake--
For my family.

393
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:47,417
Oh...

394
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,784
- All right, fine, fine.
- Thanks. Oh, god, thanks.

395
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:53,317
Go to the airport for you. This
is really unbelievable, charlie.

396
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:54,917
Go just go to the airport.
Get to the terminal,

397
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,550
and you're charlie
the limo driver, man.

398
00:17:57,684 --> 00:18:00,784
Just pick up john mcenroe. Take
him wherever he wants to go, okay?

399
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:02,584
John mcenroe?

400
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:04,617
Yeah, john mcenroe. Take him
wherever he wants to go, okay?

401
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,617
He's the tennis guy.
As far as he knows,

402
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:08,217
you're charlie the limo
driver, man. That's it.

403
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:10,517
- Stand there.
- I'm charlie, cool.

404
00:18:10,617 --> 00:18:14,150
- You're the man.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Mcenroe. I'm charlie.

405
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,484
Hey, Mr. Mcenroe, hiya.

406
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:18,884
How you doing?
I'm charlie.

407
00:18:18,983 --> 00:18:22,584
All right, hey.
Okay, I got it.

408
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,250
Ah!

409
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,617
Okay.

410
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:44,150
- Let me get that.
- Yeah, thanks.

411
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,250
I got it.

412
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,150
- Okay, give me this, please.
- Thank you.

413
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,884
All right, charlie.

414
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:54,617
- Charlie, john mcenroe.
- John mcenroe, nice to meet you.

415
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,617
- Pleasure.
- Thanks.

416
00:18:56,784 --> 00:18:59,083
- Where you heading?
- Going to the staples center for the mccartney concert.

417
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:01,016
- Oh, no kidding.
- Yeah.

418
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,383
- Good. How was the flight?
- It was all right.

419
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,350
It was all right.

420
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,450
How you doing,
mr. Mcenroe?

421
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,983
Good. Good, thanks.

422
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,983
You let old charlie know
whatever you need.

423
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,183
- Charlie's your guy.
- All right, charlie.

424
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:21,350
- Thanks.
- Charlie is your man. Don't be shy.

425
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,817
Charlie, listen. Little
tired right now, okay? Thanks.

426
00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:27,717
Hey, let me ask you something.
Were you shy as a child?

427
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:29,884
- Were you shy?
- Yeah yeah, I was actually.

428
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:31,684
Like, I was shy
when I was a kid.

429
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:34,350
People always saying,
"don't be shy. Don't be shy."

430
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,350
What, do you think you
have control of being shy?

431
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,383
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

432
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,817
Ever play ping pong? Ping pong's
my game. I'll tell you something:

433
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:44,250
I think it's a lot harder than
tennis, with all due respect.

434
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,517
I'm gonna have to respectfully
disagree with that, charlie.

435
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:50,150
What do you do for fun? How
does a john mcenroe have fun?

436
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,550
I like to be quiet now,
believe it or not.

437
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,350
- You watch a lot of tv?
- Lot of sports.

438
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,417
- You have allergies?
- No allergies.

439
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,183
Do you believe in god,
a god of some kind?

440
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,083
Yeah, I believe
in a god,

441
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:04,717
and I'm wondering
where he is right now.

442
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:07,750
- You like life?
- Yeah, I like life!

443
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:10,550
- Do you garden?
- I don't garden, okay?

444
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,750
If you talk to people who garden,
they'll all tell you the same thing:

445
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:16,283
they find it very relaxing
and meditative.

446
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:19,016
And it looks like it. I admit
it. I'm jealous of the gardener.

447
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:21,951
- Have you ever been jealous of a gardener?
- No, I haven't, actually.

448
00:20:22,016 --> 00:20:23,550
- Are you married?
- Yeah, I'm married!

449
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:27,584
- I have sex once a week.
How about you?

450
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,584
- Is that too personal?
- Yeah, that's too personal, okay?

451
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:32,283
What's the big deal
to talk about that?

452
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,550
I don't understand it.
I have sex once a week--

453
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,684
Good week, twice. But I
can go more than one week.

454
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:39,116
Hey, that's really
interesting, okay, charlie?

455
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:41,217
Oh my god.
Hey, I need to make a stop

456
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:44,250
for two minutes-- would that
be okay-- at this cemetery?

457
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,584
- In this cemetery?
- Yeah, it's right here. I can't believe it.

458
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:49,250
I just need to make a stop
just for a couple of minutes.

459
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:53,884
- All right, whatever.
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

460
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,050
- I appreciate that. You're a good man.
- Yeah yeah.

461
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:03,851
Hey, charlie, how long
is this gonna take?

462
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:06,650
I'll just be two minutes.
Here, check out this freak book.

463
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,584
- It's a riot.
- All right, fine.

464
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,584
- Great. Looks wonderful.
- It's a lot of fun.

465
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:13,784
Check out the freaks,
mr. Mcenroe.

466
00:21:19,784 --> 00:21:23,150
It's not what you had. What you
had was the best we have to offer.

467
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,417
It was absolutely
spectacular.

468
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,317
Yeah, well,
I'm done with that one.

469
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:30,383
However,
this is not bad.

470
00:21:30,484 --> 00:21:32,684
You have a nice class
of people here

471
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:35,584
and a nice view.

472
00:21:35,684 --> 00:21:37,116
It's quiet.

473
00:21:37,217 --> 00:21:40,116
Can I get a refund
on the other plot?

474
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,951
No, I can't do that,

475
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:44,650
but you can sell it
privately if you like.

476
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,350
Okay, that's fair.
Okay.

477
00:21:49,884 --> 00:21:53,250
I'll take it.

478
00:22:04,617 --> 00:22:07,250
What the fuck?

479
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,417
Charlie!

480
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:38,317
What?
This is not your limo.

481
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,150
No no no no no,

482
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,884
this is not your limo.
This is somebody else's limo.

483
00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:45,684
I pay you. I do whatever.
Just take my sister home.

484
00:22:45,784 --> 00:22:48,484
- Give him the money.
- Look, the guy's coming.

485
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:51,884
My sister will...
I know. I know.

486
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:55,183
The guy's coming. Help
him get into the car.

487
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:57,183
- Charlie, what the hell?
- Close the door.

488
00:22:57,283 --> 00:22:59,983
Just get out.
Close the door.

489
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:01,717
They think it's their car.
I don't know.

490
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:03,283
- Get in, get in.
- What is this?

491
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:05,350
Why is he coming in?
Why are you--

492
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,817
- It's his car.
- What are you coming in for?

493
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:10,250
- We need to go home.
- Where do you live?

494
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,250
- What the fuck is--
- 22509th street.

495
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,884
I don't care where they live.
Let's get 'em out of here.

496
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:19,617
You know what? That's not that
far from the staples center.

497
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:22,717
- Yeah, right. Okay, great.
- Thank you so much.

498
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:43,450
Now we are
nowhere near this place.

499
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,717
We are nowhere near-- I don't
know where this place is.

500
00:23:46,817 --> 00:23:48,417
- I can't find this place.

501
00:23:48,517 --> 00:23:50,550
- What?
- You have to just make a left turn.

502
00:23:50,684 --> 00:23:52,050
No, this isn't close.

503
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,317
You said 8th street, right?
This is not 8th street.

504
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:56,951
Charlie, I didn't pay
for this. Come on!

505
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,450
All you have to do
is make a left turn.

506
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:03,250
You told me to go this way. I
went completely the wrong way.

507
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,917
- You're supposed to be a driver.
- It's the other way, I think.

508
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:08,283
Okay, you just said the
word, "I think." don't think.

509
00:24:08,383 --> 00:24:10,083
Just follow
my instructions!

510
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:12,183
I'm telling you,
make a left turn!

511
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,450
Don't make this worse
than it already is.

512
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,717
Just make a left turn
and take us home!

513
00:24:18,817 --> 00:24:20,884
This is all we need
to do because my sister--

514
00:24:21,016 --> 00:24:23,083
that's it.
That's it!

515
00:24:23,183 --> 00:24:25,817
That's it.
I can't take this anymore!

516
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:28,283
Charlie, pull the car over. That's it!

517
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:30,283
Pull the car over,
god damn it!

518
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:33,784
I gotta get to the concert. I don't
care about your fucking father.

519
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:36,550
Pull over! I don't
care about him, okay?

520
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,750
Charlie, get me to the
show. Jesus christ!

521
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:42,116
Come on, quick.
Get out of here.

522
00:24:42,217 --> 00:24:43,917
What are you doing?

523
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:52,083
Yeah, fuck you, too, all
right? Yeah, kiss my-- !

524
00:24:57,717 --> 00:25:00,383
- God, we made it, charlie?
- We made it.

525
00:25:00,517 --> 00:25:02,016
- Yeah!
- We made it, mac!

526
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,383
Hey, and this book-- I gotta
tell you, this book is great.

527
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:07,317
- Are you loving that freak book, huh?
- This freak book is sick.

528
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,016
You see, you were worried. I
told you I'd get you here on time.

529
00:25:10,116 --> 00:25:13,217
I knew I was gonna make the show on time,
but just worried about this pre-party.

530
00:25:13,317 --> 00:25:15,951
- I got this pass to this pre-party.
It's awesome. - really?

531
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,484
Got any extra tickets?

532
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,350
What do you mean?
You're a driver, man.

533
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,016
Hey, if the situation were
reversed, I'd let you go.

534
00:25:22,116 --> 00:25:24,283
All right, fine.
Fine, all right.

535
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,750
You know what? We'll
bring the freak book.

536
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:28,083
What do you think?

537
00:25:28,183 --> 00:25:31,983
Hey, charlie,
get me another beer.

538
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,283
- Charlie, come here. You gotta see this.
- Mmm.

539
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:37,884
I'm smashed. We're gonna need a driver.

540
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:40,851
Charlie, thanks.
I gotta tell you,

541
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:43,951
this is awesome. Thank
you for this book, man.

542
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,417
- No no no, let me hold it.
- You've been holding it the whole time.

543
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:48,484
- I like it.
- We'll split it. We'll share it.

544
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:50,116
- All right, fine fine.
- Okay.

545
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,016
- Three legs!
- Where?

546
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:54,550
- There!
- No no!

547
00:25:54,684 --> 00:25:56,584
- Three legs! What is that?
- Pig nose.

548
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:58,750
- It's a pig. It's a human pig!
- Pig nose!

549
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,584
Oh, god!

550
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,217
- What a freak!
- Oh my god,

551
00:26:02,283 --> 00:26:04,484
- what a freak!
- It's heather.

552
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:12,650
Who you calling a
freak, you bald fuck?

553
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,383
Why would I call
heather mills a freak?

554
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:15,851
We weren't talking
about her!

555
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,050
I was talking about the book.
There's freaks in here.

556
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,217
See? Look. Four tits.
You see the four tits?

557
00:26:20,283 --> 00:26:22,116
That's a freak. That's
what I'm talking about.

558
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:24,917
- Please, one more chance.
- I was only talking about the book.

559
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,584
- Why would I do that?
- This is all your fault!

560
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:29,383
Why'd you bring
that fucking book?

561
00:26:29,484 --> 00:26:32,050
- You yelled, "what a freak."
- You yelled, "what a freak," too!

562
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,983
You yelled it first.
I was just following you!

563
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,884
God damn it! We're
gonna Miss the show now!

564
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:38,050
- That's not my fault.
- Bullshit! It is your fault.

565
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,750
- No, it isn't.
- God damn it, you're an asshole, you know that?

566
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,617
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

567
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,584
- No, fuck you!
- Fuck you!

568
00:26:44,684 --> 00:26:47,417
- Go get the fucking car.
- Get a ride home. How about that?

569
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,684
Holy shit!

570
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:06,250
- Hey, lar.
- Hey.

571
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,083
- Returning the car.
- Yeah, thanks.

572
00:27:08,217 --> 00:27:10,150
What's... What's...

573
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,050
- Her dad died yesterday.
- Oh, jeez.

574
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,717
If it's
the neighbor again,

575
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:18,350
say I'm sorry
I'm crying.

576
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:20,617
I'm sorry to hear
about your father.

577
00:27:20,717 --> 00:27:24,617
So sudden, and he didn't
wanna go, man. He fought it.

578
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:27,350
He fought it like a
trouper, that old asshole.

579
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,283
What are we gonna do?
I can't afford a funeral.

580
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:33,417
I can't afford anything.
Where we gonna bury him?

581
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:40,350
I think
I can help you out.
