1
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:16,824
It's something a Kentucky farmer
says she's never seen before...

2
00:00:16,863 --> 00:00:19,855
a hen taking newborn puppies
under her wing.

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,461
So guess who canceled
lunch with me again?

4
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:25,562
- Susie Greene.
- Really?

5
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:29,735
Yeah, and this time the excuse was she
had to go to the dentist.

6
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:32,244
- Maybe she had to go to the dentist.
- Okay, that's bullshit.

7
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,079
That's the adult equivalent of "The dog
ate my homework."

8
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:38,949
I'm not making anymore dates with her.
She's done it to me before.

9
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:41,510
If she doesn't want to go to lunch,
why doesn't she say,

10
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:44,251
"You know what? I'd rather not go
to lunch with you"?

11
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,657
Maybe she was
telling the truth.

12
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:50,185
I don't think so.

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,721
Listen, are you going to
your office tomorrow?

14
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:54,529
Can you do me
a favor?

15
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:56,126
Maybe.

16
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:58,729
- Can't you just say yes?
- No.

17
00:00:58,772 --> 00:01:00,797
What kind of favor am I gonna ask
you wouldn't say yes to?

18
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:04,607
- What do you want?
- I saw the osteopath about my cough

19
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:07,807
and he told me I should get some
colon cleanse.

20
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:10,373
It's actually called
"colon cleanse."

21
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:14,444
It helps the whole system.
He said it will flush...

22
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:18,083
What does that have to do with a cough?
I don't understand that.

23
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,822
He says it'll
knock it out like that.

24
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:23,625
So please will you
do that for me?

25
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:25,130
All right.

26
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:27,360
Speaking of good eating,
here's Andy Portico

27
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,562
with this week's
restaurant review. Andy?

28
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:32,197
Oh, Andy Portico's
reviewing a new restaurant.

29
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,503
Today I'll be talking about
"Stuffing Your Face" again.

30
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,509
I don't think I've eaten as badly
since I was in the army.

31
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:38,602
- At least then I had my youth.
- Asshole.

32
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:40,840
These people could've
learned something from Army food.

33
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:44,112
- Oh my God. This guy is so brutal.
- I'd rather eat C-rations...

34
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:45,982
than the swill
they serve in this place.

35
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:49,750
It's a criminal enterprise, not
a restaurant, and these people...

36
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,157
- This place is gonna close in two days.
- All because of this.

37
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:54,854
He's coming
to the opening next week.

38
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:56,522
- Really?
- Yeah.

39
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:59,293
- But you repaired...
- All the digging, yeah. Shh, quiet.

40
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:01,300
I'm gonna have to give it

41
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:03,632
a big two thumbs down.

42
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,106
- What a surprise!
- I'm Andy Portico, thanks for watching.

43
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,767
- Isn't that clever?
- Yeah.

44
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,970
The thumbs down.

45
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,206
It's real original,
the thumbs down.

46
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:16,844
It's really awful
that this guy's...

47
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:19,511
he's controlling the fate
of our restaurant practically.

48
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,783
I know, it's so
subjective, isn't it?

49
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:23,847
- It's terrible.
- How does he decide?

50
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,120
Guy couldn't
get dates.

51
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,492
He takes it out
on the rest of the world.

52
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:31,656
I couldn't get dates. You don't see
me taking it out on anybody.

53
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:33,359
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,459
I don't know
about that.

55
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:37,163
But don't you know
somebody who knows him,

56
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:39,229
could put in
a good word?

57
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:41,706
Jeff's daughter goes
to the same school as his son.

58
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:43,800
That's a start,
right?

59
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:45,004
Jeff's not gonna
say anything.

60
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:50,513
Good night.

61
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,110
What the hell are you kissing me good
night for with that cough?

62
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:55,314
Can you get
the lights, please?

63
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:59,353
You know how bookstores make you
feel stupid?

64
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:02,657
Health food stores
make me feel unhealthy.

65
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:06,489
What's this bullshit,
Susie making up this story

66
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,467
about going
to the dentist?

67
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,732
She had a dentist
appointment.

68
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,705
- Cheryl doesn't believe a word of it.
- I was with her.

69
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,435
She keeps breaking
appointments with Cheryl.

70
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:18,000
I was with her.
What do you want?

71
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:20,604
- I can't find this colon cleanser.
- Ask somebody.

72
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:23,810
- We've been up and down 10 times.
- Ask somebody, that's why.

73
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,011
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

74
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:27,952
I'm looking
for a colon cleanser.

75
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:30,582
Adam, where's
the colon cleanse?

76
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:32,717
- The what?
- The colon cleanse.

77
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,456
Colon cleanse is aisle G,
right behind you.

78
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:39,590
Okay.
It's around the corner, right there.

79
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:42,067
It's for my wife.
It's for my wife.

80
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:54,277
- Who's that guy?
- I don't know.

81
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:56,509
Boy, does he
look familiar.

82
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:00,951
Does he not look
familiar to you?

83
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:03,649
Who is that?
I know that...

84
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,985
- That's our chef.
- Our chef's bald.

85
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:12,089
That's the chef.

86
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:17,133
Hey!

87
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,107
Hey, Larry.

88
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:24,372
- Phil, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:28,671
What's with the...?

90
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:32,508
- I thought you said you didn't want...
- Well, yeah, I did.

91
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:34,884
- Came into the interview?
- Yes.

92
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:38,288
I just assumed...
and I was right...

93
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:40,293
that you were one
of those people

94
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,557
who find that men
who enhance their appearance

95
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:46,123
are wrong
and stupid so I took my toupee off.

96
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,067
You came in bald
just to get the job?

97
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:53,403
I'm sorry
I deceived you.

98
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,002
I hope this doesn't, you know,
affect, you know...

99
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:59,136
Well, I'm sorry,
but it will.

100
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:01,647
You got hired
under false pretenses.

101
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:03,649
But it had nothing
to do with my food.

102
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:06,243
- I know, but I don't trust you.
- What are you talking about?

103
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:08,447
No, I'm sorry.

104
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,218
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Let's go.

105
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:19,193
I mean, what
was he thinking?

106
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:20,859
For the next
five years was he gonna come in

107
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,868
every day and
leave the toupee at home?

108
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:25,268
Yeah, right.
Or just wear it on weekends?

109
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:27,466
Live
a double life.

110
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,634
- Unbelievable.
- He had no plan.

111
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,702
He had a good plan.
He knew how to get hired.

112
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:35,078
Oh, like you wouldn't
hire a fat guy, huh?

113
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:37,276
You don't have
a proclivity for fat people?

114
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,945
I think you got
a strong proclivity for fat people.

115
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:42,250
If a fat guy came in,
you wouldn't want to hire him?

116
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:44,722
You would've been
all over that fat guy.

117
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:46,658
You would've
loved that fat guy, don't tell me.

118
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:49,059
All things being equal,
I'd hire the fat guy.

119
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,222
That's right.
By the way, it's not like I don't hire

120
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,129
other people
who aren't bald, okay?

121
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,192
I don't have a bald manager.
I don't have a bald lawyer.

122
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:58,067
You have a bald
accountant,

123
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:01,767
a bald urologist,
a bald travel agent.

124
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:05,039
You have far more bald professionals
than the average person.

125
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:08,411
- Okay, so I do, so what?
- I just want you to notice.

126
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:10,507
Okay, I notice.
It's duly noted.

127
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,415
I knew you'd say
"duly noted," too.

128
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:14,079
- Oh, did you? You're so smart.
- I knew.

129
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,088
You know everything I say
before I say it?

130
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:18,590
- Before you say it.
- What a genius you are.

131
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,025
- "What a genius you are."
- You knew I was gonna say that, too?

132
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:23,052
I knew you were
gonna say that.

133
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:27,829
Aw, Jeez. Listen,
I got to go...

134
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,926
We are in so much
trouble here, oh my God.

135
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,698
I got to tell
these investors now...

136
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:35,174
what just happened, we have no chef.
This just stinks.

137
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,041
Yeah, wow, you got to tell them.
I'll be there with you,

138
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:40,376
but you got to tell them.
We open in four days,

139
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:42,506
no chef, and you're
gonna tell them

140
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:44,710
you just fired our chef because
he wears a toupee.

141
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:46,275
Listen, I got to go
to Sammy's school,

142
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,446
drop off her lunch,
and then I'll take you to your office.

143
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:58,956
I don't understand. Your daughter
goes here? I see older kids.

144
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:01,364
It's K-12,
the whole thing.

145
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:04,837
Oh, oh dear,
aw, look at that.

146
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:07,431
Poor kid lost his hair,
he's getting chemo.

147
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:09,567
No, he's not going
through chemotherapy.

148
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:12,544
Another kid in class is,
and a lot of the boys

149
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:15,446
in the senior class as a show
of solidarity shaved their heads.

150
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,507
- Really?
- Yeah.

151
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:23,917
That's really something.
You know what?

152
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,323
Maybe one day
I'll get a chance

153
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,384
to do something
good for somebody like that.

154
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:30,396
That's really
touching.

155
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,728
You've already got
kind of a head start, actually.

156
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,860
Funny.

157
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:41,897
What's all this?

158
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,501
The parents and the kids,
they play dodge ball.

159
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:47,069
- Oh, yeah? Wow.
- Yeah.

160
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:50,412
- You know?
- Huh.

161
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,042
- Hey, is that...?
- Andy Portico.

162
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:54,212
- That's Portico?
- Come on!

163
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:57,655
Boy, is he into it. Have you ever talked
to him about the restaurant?

164
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,555
I wouldn't
dare.

165
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,262
I used to love playing dodge ball.
You like dodge ball?

166
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:05,662
- Oh, yeah.
- Why don't you get in the game?

167
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:07,996
Aw, they got a whole thing
going here.

168
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:10,468
- They can add... it's a fun game.
- I'm not gonna ask them.

169
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:13,666
Come on. Sandra?
Can my friend play?

170
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,401
Sure!

171
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:18,035
Go ahead. I'm gonna go take
the lunchbox to Sammy.

172
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:19,874
- I'll see you in a few.
- I'm gonna play some dodge ball.

173
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:22,438
Have a good time.

174
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:24,746
Okay, let's get
going here.

175
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:28,117
All right, Larry David.
I'm coming to your restaurant next week.

176
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:30,714
- Oh, okay.
- I'm gonna review it.

177
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:39,692
Come on, Larry,
ha, ha, ha, ha.

178
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:47,199
Aw-ww!

179
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,135
You're out!

180
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:57,849
- All right, you're out.
- It hit the ground.

181
00:08:57,884 --> 00:08:59,852
- Bullshit!
- Hit the ground!

182
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:01,615
- Get out of there!
- Hit the ground, Portico.

183
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:04,122
You're out!

184
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:12,056
Ow, fuck!

185
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,589
What have you done?

186
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,801
What the fuck?

187
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,209
Sorry.

188
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:27,277
How could this
possibly happen?

189
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:28,940
What were you doing
playing dodge ball with Andy Portico?

190
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:32,884
Adults were playing, okay?
It was a parents/kids game.

191
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:36,116
W-what are you swinging so hard for?
You're injuring him.

192
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,248
- What are you doing?
- I got involved in the game.

193
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,384
He was acting like
a bit of an asshole, too, by the way.

194
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:43,327
- It wasn't all my fault.
- What about the cook?

195
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:46,355
We open in three days,
we don't have a chef.

196
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,060
Well, the guy
was full of shit.

197
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:50,535
He tried to pass himself off
as bald and he wasn't bald.

198
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,333
- What do you want me to do?
- So big deal.

199
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:54,499
He wears a toupee when he's not here.
Who cares?

200
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,735
He's liar.
The guy's a bald-faced...

201
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:59,506
literally...
a bald-faced liar.

202
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:03,845
We've got more problems than that.
We have lost investors.

203
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:06,351
- Ted's gone.
- Ted Danson is gone.

204
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:08,854
But I made up
that money, so what...?

205
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:11,288
We are trying
to open a restaurant.

206
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:15,761
You've got to pull us out of this mire
that we are wallowing in.

207
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:18,229
What about the muck,
are we in any muck?

208
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:21,097
We are in a big muck.
We don't have a chef.

209
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:23,068
If we're in mire, I would assume
that we're also in muck.

210
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:26,868
Usually one is in muck and mire.
He said I was in a mire.

211
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:29,932
I was trying to ascertain whether or not
muck was involved as well.

212
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:31,807
- You were trying to ascertain?
- Yes.

213
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:35,940
- Let's not change the subject because...
- "Ascertain."

214
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:37,347
You know, all
of this is moot

215
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:39,317
because after
what he did to Portico

216
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:41,843
he's gonna
slaughter us, okay?

217
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:44,254
He's gonna put his thumbs
through the table.

218
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,520
Apologize to Portico.

219
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,993
I'll apologize.
It's not gonna...

220
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:50,996
Apologize to Portico,
that's it.

221
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,998
What's the big
deal, Larry?

222
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:55,000
"I'm sorry.
I'm sorry."

223
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:57,059
All right,
I'll go apologize.

224
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:59,367
Let's talk about a new chef.
Everybody's got...

225
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,805
You know, Ted knew another guy...
never mind.

226
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,478
- Oh, Larry.
- Andy.

227
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,749
Yeah, you know, I'd get up
and shake your hand

228
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:19,224
except I don't really have any hands
to shake, you know?

229
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:21,226
Oh my gosh.

230
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,353
This is what happens
when you break your thumbs.

231
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,864
Oh, God Almighty.

232
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:28,628
- Like a fucking Muppet.
- I'm so sorry, Andy.

233
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry, too.

234
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:33,028
We were playing a game
and we were into it...

235
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:36,803
And you threw the thing
like it was a fucking hydrogen bomb.

236
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:39,539
I just... I hadn't played in a long time
and I was having fun and...

237
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:44,414
Well, I won't be able
to review the restaurant, of course.

238
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,543
Why not?

239
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,554
Because I can't do
"thumbs up, thumbs down."

240
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:50,556
That's my
whole gimmick.

241
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,115
I can't do the show
for two months, what am I gonna do?

242
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:56,128
- I can't do this...
- Because you can't...

243
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:58,130
I can't
do my shtick.

244
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:02,794
- Oh, what a shame.
- Yeah, well.

245
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:05,395
- You can't do...
- "Thumbs up, thumbs down."

246
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:07,099
- You can't go like this?
- I can't go like this.

247
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,903
From a stupid
dodge ball game?

248
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:11,637
From a stupid
dodge ball game.

249
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:13,474
Well, in any event,
it's a shame

250
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:15,845
that you're gonna miss the opening
of the restaurant.

251
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:17,873
You're not gonna
be able to review it.

252
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,817
What am I talking
about, opening?

253
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,683
There's no opening
anyway because we don't have a chef.

254
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,189
- You lost your chef?
- Lost the chef, yeah.

255
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:26,885
Well, that's
crucial.

256
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:29,895
Yeah, I'd say.

257
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,732
You know,
as it happens,

258
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:36,291
I know a great chef

259
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:38,860
who just left Martine's.
You know Martine's?

260
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,896
Of course I know Martine's
in New York.

261
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,465
As a matter of fact, he's out here now.
He's weighing offers.

262
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:45,704
I got to get
this guy's name.

263
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:47,872
Guy Bernier
is his name.

264
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:49,939
- Guy Bernier?
- Guy Bernier.

265
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:52,473
I could put in
a word for you.

266
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:54,816
- Would you?
- I have a lot credibility with him.

267
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:57,618
This is... I don't
even know what to say.

268
00:12:57,657 --> 00:13:01,218
Hey, look, I'm happy to do it.
No hard feelings, honestly.

269
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,820
It's like this could've
happened to anyone.

270
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:07,458
I brought you your lunch.
Excuse me.

271
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,527
It's spaghetti with marinara sauce
and some cheese.

272
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:13,698
Okay, you fucking idiot,
you fucking moron.

273
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:16,970
How am I supposed to eat that?
Suck it up my ass?

274
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:18,874
Didn't I ask you
to get me a protein shake

275
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:21,277
or something I could eat, you know,
like through a straw?

276
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:24,442
I'm fucking hungry, so order me
something. I don't care what it is.

277
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:28,181
- Get me something I can fucking eat!
- I'll order something else.

278
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:31,486
- Jesus. It's not like...
- Fucking idiot, you know?

279
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:34,857
Hey, you know what? Don't worry
about it, I'll help you out here.

280
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:38,022
Let's make this happen.
Okay? Come on.

281
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:39,725
No, come on now,
really, honestly.

282
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:42,563
Listen, don't...
Andy, will you stop it?

283
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:45,127
- Please, now really.
- No, no, you please.

284
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:47,833
No, I...
no, come on.

285
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:49,899
Good, good, good.

286
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:52,706
It's good, isn't it?

287
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:57,214
Oh, Andy!
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry.

288
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,411
What the fuck
are you doing?

289
00:13:59,452 --> 00:14:01,181
Here you go.

290
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:10,688
I think I should mention
that I have one problem.

291
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,392
And that problem
is with salmon.

292
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:16,959
I won't buy it,
I won't broil it I won't bake it.

293
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:20,530
Oh.
You got a problem with salmon, huh?

294
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:22,632
- A big problem.
- Big problem?

295
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:26,543
- Well, we won't have salmon, right?
- No, absolutely.

296
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,479
- Salmon's out.
- Plenty of fish in the sea.

297
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:32,041
- Who needs it?
- And also... caper.

298
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:35,110
I can't stand capers either.
I don't like them.

299
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:37,384
If I see one caper
in the kitchen,

300
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:39,084
there's going
to be big problem.

301
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,322
Uh-huh, okay.
All right, no capers.

302
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,522
- No capers.
- All right.

303
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:47,533
- Okay?
- Yes.

304
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,762
Oh, this is great.

305
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:51,895
Do you remember
Martine's in New York?

306
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:54,406
Sure, I've been there
about three or four times.

307
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,931
- This is the guy.
- I know.

308
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:01,106
Et voila.

309
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:05,182
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.

310
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:08,745
- Thank you.
- Is my pleasure. Is fantastic spot.

311
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:10,722
- We're thrilled to have you.
- I am thrilled too.

312
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:12,986
Okay, well, now I have appointment.
I have to go.

313
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:16,961
- So, okay, bye.
- See you tomorrow.

314
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:18,759
- This is... I can't...
- Well, Larry...

315
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:20,698
Nice job.

316
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,099
Shit, shitface fuck,
shit, cocksucker.

317
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,069
I bet he got
a ticket.

318
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:27,538
He's got some 'tude,
this guy, huh?

319
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:30,167
Some champagne?
Shall we break out the champagne?

320
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:33,144
Yeah, let's crack open a bottle
of the good stuff.

321
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:38,806
Look at your car.
Why is your car always so filthy?

322
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:43,548
Are you kidding me?

323
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:45,557
Ugh, it's dirty.
All of it.

324
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:47,718
- Inside, outside...
- Sit down.

325
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,421
- Am I gonna get dirty?
- Huh?

326
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:51,396
You need to wash this,
seriously.

327
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,125
Okay, fine,
I'll wash it right now.

328
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:54,894
Not now.

329
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:57,869
You can't do it now.
I'm meeting Susie for lunch.

330
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:00,371
It's right on the way,
don't worry about it.

331
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,806
This is our make-up lunch
I don't want to be late for it.

332
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:05,003
It takes
two minutes.

333
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,936
I just don't want
another falling-out with her.

334
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:30,929
Listen to how low
my voice is today.

335
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,066
Oh, hey... down,
down, down-nn.

336
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:37,473
I'm starting to get
stomach cramps...

337
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,375
- Down, down-nn...
...from that colon cleanse.

338
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:41,710
Hear that note?
Down-nn.

339
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:43,874
Outstanding.

340
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,612
And they are miles
down-nn...

341
00:16:46,652 --> 00:16:49,712
How long do you think
this is gonna last?

342
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:52,656
I think I have to find
a bathroom pretty soon.

343
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:54,956
It's really,
like...

344
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:57,485
What's the deal here?
Are we even moving?

345
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,124
Are we moving?

346
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,532
How long is this thing supposed to take?
Do you know?

347
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:05,901
I got news for you.
We're not even moving.

348
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:08,839
- Are we stuck in this thing?
- We're not moving.

349
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:11,775
- Hey!
- Hello?!

350
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:15,676
Hey!

351
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:20,916
- Larry, seriously...
- Hey... bang on your window.

352
00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:24,787
- Hey!
- Oh my God.

353
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:27,292
Seriously, I'm seriously
starting to...

354
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:29,556
it's getting to the point
of an emergency.

355
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:31,995
I can't be in this car
for much longer.

356
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,727
Hey!

357
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:37,133
Hey!

358
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,399
- Wait a second.
- Oh my God.

359
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,838
- Let me call Information.
- Seriously.

360
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:44,069
- I'll get them on the phone.
- I'm getting sweaty.

361
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,739
- I got to go, I really got to go.
- Just hold on a second.

362
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,614
Hello, yes,
I'd like the number of Glen-Rock...

363
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,746
Glen...
Glen-Rock!

364
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:58,723
Glen-Rock!

365
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:02,990
R-o-c-k,
Los Angeles!

366
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:05,019
Yes, connect!

367
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:11,927
Glen-Rock Car Wash.

368
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:15,737
Hello, I'm stuck
in your car wash!

369
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:18,335
What?

370
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:20,572
I said I'm stuck
in your car wash!

371
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:23,081
- Tell them it's an emergency.
- It's an emer...

372
00:18:23,115 --> 00:18:26,209
- They need to turn it off or something.
- Turn off your car wash!

373
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:28,914
I can't hear a word
you're saying.

374
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:30,819
Turn off
your car wash!

375
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:33,450
- What are they saying?
- Call back later.

376
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:37,892
Oh God, Larry, I can't wait.
I got to go.

377
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,093
I got to go. I got to go!
I got to go!

378
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:57,814
I'm just saying
Susie's crazed, man.

379
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,818
She hung up
on Cheryl.

380
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:02,548
A car wash?
Who gets stuck in a car wash?

381
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:05,250
It's the truth.
We were stuck in a car wash.

382
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,122
You weren't stuck
in a car wash.

383
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:10,458
The car got stuck in one spot and she
got out and she was soaking wet.

384
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:13,090
- That's why she canceled.
- You're telling me the truth?

385
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:15,191
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I believe you,

386
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:17,759
- but Susie's never gonna believe this.
- Well, whatever, you know.

387
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:20,636
So let me ask you,

388
00:19:20,673 --> 00:19:22,698
are you thinking
about anything

389
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:24,709
that you want to put
on the table

390
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:28,338
before people come in
when they first sit down?

391
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,975
Do you want to have
bread or something, or breadsticks?

392
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:34,212
- Olives.
- Like a pickle.

393
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:36,949
Olives?
No, I'm sorry for interruption,

394
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:39,457
but they are really
ridiculous, olives.

395
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:42,052
What do you do with pit?
Ever, never,

396
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:44,028
you can do nothing with pit.
It's ridiculous.

397
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:46,031
No olives.
I'm sorry...

398
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:48,226
Put in a pit plate or an ashtray
or something.

399
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:51,964
A pit plate?
Why don't you call it a garbage plate?

400
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:55,462
- Okay.
- Yeah, he's right.

401
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:57,032
The personality
on this guy, huh?

402
00:19:57,076 --> 00:19:59,510
He's a piece
of work.

403
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,013
- What else?
- Carrot sticks, celery.

404
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:06,779
What about lemon
in the water?

405
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:09,219
Motherfucking
cocksucker asshole!

406
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:22,026
I'm starting
to think that that's involuntary.

407
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:25,127
Et voila.
Everything is finished now.

408
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,071
It's perfect, it's fantastic, okay?
I just want to say one thing.

409
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:30,769
I am so humbled
to be working

410
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,777
in such a restaurant
of quality, huh?

411
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:34,870
- It's fantastic.
- Oh, it's an honor.

412
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:37,747
Bye bye. I see you
tomorrow, yes?

413
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:39,614
See you tomorrow.

414
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:44,820
- What do they call that, Tourette's?
- Tourette's Syndrome.

415
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:47,587
Wow. He's got
Tourette's Syndrome.

416
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,253
Portico.

417
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:53,126
Portico.

418
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:55,429
Sure. He was
recommended...

419
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:58,265
- Portico.
- Fucking Portico!

420
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,272
That prick,
I don't believe it.

421
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:03,867
He's laughing right now.
That motherfucker.

422
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:06,377
You believe that guy would do something
like that on purpose?

423
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:08,312
Of course he would.

424
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:10,474
The joke's on us 'cause we need
to find another chef.

425
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:12,746
Yeah, we got
to let him go.

426
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:14,753
What? We're opening tomorrow.
You want to let him go?

427
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:18,723
It would be different if the kitchen
didn't look out onto the dining room.

428
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:21,385
He's practically
on stage over there.

429
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:23,554
- It's the design of this room.
- It's like a floor show.

430
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:25,564
We're gonna be known
as "the restaurant

431
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,691
with the chef
that swears."

432
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:30,759
This is a nightmare.
This'll ruin us.

433
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:33,067
We're gonna be a laughingstock if we
allow this to happen.

434
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:34,572
Are you kidding me?
We have to get rid of him.

435
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:36,700
- No.
- What do you mean no?

436
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:38,937
- We can't fire him.
- Why?

437
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:42,004
He's a survivor.

438
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:47,445
Then I called Martine's...

439
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:49,681
that's the restaurant
where he used to work in New York.

440
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:51,121
Okay.

441
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:54,557
They told me that their kitchen
was in the back...

442
00:21:56,362 --> 00:21:59,195
so the cursing didn't bother anybody.
There was too much noise.

443
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:01,495
The only people who could hear him
worked in the kitchen.

444
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:03,933
But our kitchen's
right in the front.

445
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:06,403
He's gonna be right there,
cursing up a storm.

446
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:09,305
People could be
eating their dinner.

447
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:12,469
- Oh my God.
- Of course you couldn't fire him.

448
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:14,741
Yeah, I'm not gonna
fire a survivor.

449
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,873
No, you couldn't
do that.

450
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:19,884
Whoa, wow!
Look at you!

451
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:21,943
Is it too
"Knots Landing"?

452
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:23,955
I know it's a TV show,

453
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:26,321
but I don't get
the reference at all.

454
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:29,521
- Anyway, but you like it?
- Yeah, it looks great.

455
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:32,029
- It's not too dressy?
- No, I like it.

456
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:35,158
Well, maybe he won't
curse tonight.

457
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,634
He can't control it.
Nothing he can control.

458
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,195
I've seen him twice
and he's cursed both times.

459
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:42,673
The only thing
I don't get

460
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,972
is why he doesn't
curse in French.

461
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:48,773
Why is he cursing in English?
"Mutherfuck-erre."

462
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:50,213
- Where did he get that from?
- I don't know.

463
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:52,080
"Cocksuck-erre."

464
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:54,108
- Stop it, he does not say...
- He does.

465
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:56,121
All in English,
I don't understand.

466
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,851
Aren't there obscenities in French
there that he could say?

467
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:01,951
Listen, can I just tell you,
before we even get there,

468
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:05,760
I am not looking forward
to running into Susie Greene?

469
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:07,789
Susie Greene,
yeah.

470
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,963
She hates me. She really hates me now.
She won't even talk to me.

471
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:15,303
You know? I mean,
what am I gonna do?

472
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,400
I wouldn't even go if I were you.
It's too awkward.

473
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:21,470
You're probably
right.

474
00:23:21,513 --> 00:23:24,846
Maybe I'll just sit in the car.
How about that?

475
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:27,181
Really, that's
what you should do.

476
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:28,914
All right, let's
get out of here.

477
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:44,101
- Oh, Jeez.
- Whoo!

478
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:46,127
Wow.

479
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:50,771
Look at that.
There's a room over there.

480
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,800
- Yeah, this is pretty big.
- Man!

481
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:55,780
- Huh?
- I am very impressed.

482
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:57,839
- Huh?
- Yeah.

483
00:23:57,883 --> 00:23:59,714
- Not bad.
- Not bad.

484
00:23:59,752 --> 00:24:02,346
See the bell?
Now watch this.

485
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:05,754
- Wow. It works.
- Yeah, it works.

486
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,190
- Hey.
- Hey.

487
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:09,490
- Oh, hi.
- Wow.

488
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:12,292
- Uh-huh. It's happening, my friend.
- Really cool.

489
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:14,322
Hi, Jeff,
good to see you.

490
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:17,267
This is Cheryl.
These are my investor friends.

491
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:20,294
- Wow, hi.
- Lou, Jim...

492
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:22,773
- Michael, Theresa.
- Nice to meet you.

493
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:24,639
- Hi. Great.
- What do you think?

494
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:27,008
I am very
impressed.

495
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:29,275
- She's a little knocked out, I think.
- I am.

496
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:31,782
This is not
what I expected.

497
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:33,444
We couldn't have done it
without the big guy here.

498
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:35,715
- Is that right?
- He stepped up, you know?

499
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:37,722
He stepped up.

500
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:40,657
It was a little rocky
there for a while.

501
00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:42,250
That's an
understatement.

502
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:45,229
I think Jim's had a couple
of champagnes.

503
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:47,425
I think Jim's
out of control.

504
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:49,434
I'm a little nervous,
but I think we're gonna make it.

505
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:52,096
- It really looks great.
- It does.

506
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:55,072
Eat your heart out, Ted Danson.
That's all I have to say.

507
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:56,768
Cheers.

508
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:59,801
"Cheers," yeah,
you got it.

509
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:01,642
Yeah, cheers.
Where's your wife?

510
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,547
- She'll be here in a little while.
- Uh-huh.

511
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:07,484
And what's going on
with Guy?

512
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,147
- Any outbursts?
- So far, so good.

513
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:12,555
- I haven't heard anything.
- Yeah, not a peep.

514
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:15,890
Yeah.
Oh, hey, look, there's your parents.

515
00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:18,590
Hey, there's my dad!
Hello!

516
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:33,844
Pilaf.
It's delicious.

517
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:36,871
- Bon soir.
- Ah, bon soir, how are you, eh?

518
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:39,543
Oh, trés bien,
trés bien.

519
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:41,610
The place is
a big success for you.

520
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:44,121
Oh, my gosh, can you believe
what's going on here?

521
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:47,455
- It's gigan-tique.
- And you're feeling good?

522
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:50,791
Actually, I'm quite upset.
I'm very upset.

523
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:54,697
- Really?
- I lost the lottery by one number only.

524
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:57,031
- One number?
- Yes, one!

525
00:25:57,069 --> 00:25:59,037
Yes, look at that.

526
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:02,472
I was one number off
in the lottery.

527
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:06,671
It ends with "7-1."
Here I have "4-1."

528
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:09,613
What's the point, huh?
It's all rigged, anyway.

529
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:13,106
I'm quite sure of that, huh?
Hey, turn that down.

530
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:15,312
What do you think
you are doing, cooking a goat?

531
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:21,686
- Hey... thank you.
- Congratulations.

532
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:26,520
Let's get
that waiter.

533
00:26:47,252 --> 00:26:49,220
Fuckhead, shitface,
cocksucker,

534
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:51,654
asshole,
son of a bitch!

535
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,568
Maybe one day,
I'll get a chance

536
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:06,696
to do something good
for somebody like that.

537
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:10,573
Scum-sucking,
motherfucking whore!

538
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:15,842
Cock!
Cock, jism!

539
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:18,315
Grandma, cock!

540
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,411
Bum! Fuck,
turd, fart.

541
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:27,414
Cunt, piss, shit,
bugger and balls!

542
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:31,953
Damn it, hell...
crap...

543
00:27:31,997 --> 00:27:35,933
...shit!
- You goddamn motherfucking bitch!

544
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:38,903
Fuck you,
you car wash cunt!

545
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:41,872
I had a dental
appointment!

546
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:44,569
Fellatio, cunnilingus,
French kissing!

547
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:48,035
Rim job.

548
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,310
Right, piss.

549
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:54,115
Fucking, fucking,
fuck, fuck.

550
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:56,712
Schmuck, putz,
tuchuslecker!

551
00:27:56,755 --> 00:27:58,450
Pussy, pig fucker.

552
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,651
Balls!

553
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:03,855
Boy cock, girl cock,
e-i-e-i-o.

554
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:11,066
Fuck whore tits!
