Episode 5x01: The Larry David Sandwich

2
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm drowning.

3
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,900
I'm gonna die.

4
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,300
And somewhere I'm not even...

5
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm not religious at all, I said god help me.

6
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,700
And I'm deposited, right on the beach !

7
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,300
I went swimming that day for some reason,

8
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,300
something drew me to the water.

9
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,900
Why I don't know !

10
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,900
You know it's like a baby drawn to the nipple.

11
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,704
You know what I... you know or an adult drawn to the nipple.

12
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:42,803
- Either way, right ?
- You know what I think, Larry ?

13
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,300
- Is that divine intervention ?
- Yeah !

14
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,000
- Unbelievable Larry !
- Is that not divine intervention ?

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,500
You know what I think Larry ?

16
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
I think this happened for a reason.

17
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,200
Yes, I think so too. It happened for a reason.

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,800
Now, maybe you'll start to be more respectful to people

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,500
treat people better.
- What are you talking about ?

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,700
I'm respectful to people !

21
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,100
- Umh, Larry, Uh...
- What, what Uhuh ?

22
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,200
- Whatever ! Whatever !
- I'm respecting people, I respect people !

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
- I'm very nice to people.
- Yeah, fine.

24
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,500
So, anyway, uh, amazing ?

25
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,700
Is that amazing ?

26
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,200
True story, every word !

27
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,900
To life !

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,100
- Have you gone to temple while holidays ?
- Yeah of course.

29
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,800
I think I wanna go to temple this year.

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,300
- You do ?
- Yeah, given what happened and everything

31
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,800
don't you think I should be there ?

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,900
Yeah, it's a great thing, but you gotta get your ticket like...

33
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,000
6 months in advance, it's a tough ticket to go to high holy days.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Why does a Jew need a ticket to go to temple, it's crazy ?

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
I'm not saying I justify it, but...

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,500
you need a ticket, now I've got my tickets.

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
- How am I gonna get one ?
- Um...

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,500
You know what...

39
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,800
I'll make some calls and if I hook one up, I'll call you tonight.

40
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300
We'll see...

41
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Look at this thing...

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,500
Look, 've you ever seen a handle like this on a cup

43
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
What's the point of this ?

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,900
- Looks like "pretend little tea cups".
- I can't... Yeah look !

45
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,200
Look you can't get your index finger in there, what's the point ?

46
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,800
I like watching you do that.

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,700
There was something I wanted to tell you.

48
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,500
Oh !

49
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,100
I went by Leo's delicatessen

50
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,500
and what's up on the board ?

51
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,400
A brand new sandwich called "The Larry David"

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,600
- Get out of here !
- Swear to god !

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,800
Swear to god !

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
- They named a sandwich after me ?
- They named a sandwich after you !

55
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,300
- You're kidding !
- Yep, yep, yep

56
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,900
I can't believe it, I'm on the board !

57
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,200
You're on the board.

58
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,900
What is it ?

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,900
Let's see, there is uh, whitefish...

60
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,200
uh sable,

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,200
uh capres, onions and creme cheese.
- What, what ?

62
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,100
- That's the sandwich ?
- Yeah.

63
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,100
- You got a sandwich
- That's a disgusting sandwich really.

64
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm gonna get something to eat, I'll see you later.

65
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Look at this.

66
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
- Sorry !
- Oh boy !

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Oh my gosh, oh what happened ?

68
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,900
He bumped me.

69
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,600
- Did you bump into him ?
- No

70
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,300
You bumped into me !

71
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,300
- You didn't bump into me ?
- Alright please...

72
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,100
- What happened ?
- Uh, nothing.

73
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
- Ready to go ?
- Yeah, you're ready ?

74
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,400
- We're gonna take off.
- What ?

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,600
We carpooled with you, I'm not ready to leave yet.

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,800
- It's enough already.
- Larry what the fuck ?

77
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,700

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,000
- You just got this fool.
- Alright listen...

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,400
You'll get a ride and if you don't get a ride, you give me a call.

82
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,100
- Fine yeah, you'll be here...
- Yeah you'll come back and get us.

83
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,300
- I will, I'll come back and get you.
- I believe that !

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Call me Mr. Tibbs !

85
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Don't answer that.

86
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,700
Actually it might be Jeff

87
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,000
calling about the temple tickets.
- I don't care !

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
- I don't care, come on !
- No no this is kinda important deal.

89
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,800
- Well he'll call back.
- He's not, I told him to...

90
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,200
I try and find out, hello ?

91
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,100
Made some calls but no go on the tickets.

92
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,200
- What a bummer.
- Yeah I'm sorry.

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,400
But you know what ?

94
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,800
- You can always try for a scalper
- Really ? They got scalper tickets ?

95
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,300
They usually do.

96
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
- Expensive ?
- I have no idea.

97
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,600
- Alright, I'l get some scalper tickets.
- Get some scalper tickets.

98
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
We'll just go down there and try to get some.

99
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,400
- Thanks for trying.

100
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,900

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
What ?

104
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,100
What's the big deal ? What ?

105
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,200
Why do you have to answer the phone ?

106
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,400
Cause I told you I was expecting a call.

107
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,300
Why ? So what ? I don't...

108
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,700
Good night.

109
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, right...

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,100
Mustn't interrupt intercourse !

111
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,300
Oh sacred intercourse cannot be interrupted.

112
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Everybody quiet ! Quiet for intercourse.

113
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Shhhht, don't disturb the intercourse.

114
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,100
Let me tell you something...

115
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,800
This is some kind of sandwich my friend !

116
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,200
It's the first time I really kvelled...

117
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,000
really swelled up with joy,

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,800
look at that Larry David sandwich.

119
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,500
I really kvell from this,

120
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,900
it's something that makes me proud above anything.

121
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,400
Alright, alright, I don't even like it !

122
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,200
- What ?
- I don't like it.

123
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,000
Whatever you say just now, you mumbled it

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,400
wich is something you do.

125
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,800
You do a lot, you do a lot of mumbling.

126
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,800
- Okay
- You don't have a lot of respect for speech.

127
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,100
You could speak a little clearer, it wouldn't hurt anybody

128
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,100
- Ah laughin' in my face !
- I don't have respect for speech ?

129
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,900
- That's right
- I do, I respect speech.

130
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,200
I disagree.

131
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,000
Look who's here !

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,900
Hey, Leo !

133
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,100
So good to see you.

134
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,500
Oh and Mr. David two.

135
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,300
How are you Sir, how are you ?

136
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Fine, fine, thank you.

137
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,000
Leo, first of all,

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I wanna thank you

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,200
for putting me up on the board,

140
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
having my own sandwich.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,500
Larry David sandwich.

142
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,900
Look, look how proud he is.

143
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,300
No problem, it's my pleasure to put the Larry David sandwich

144
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,402
up on the board.
- It's such a wonderful thing.

145
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:36,006
You like it, yeah ?
You like it ?

146
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:39,602
What is this, Eh ?

147
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
You know...

148
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,800
Not really a big...

149
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,100
Not really a big fish guy, to tell you the truth.

150
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,500
This is the best whitefish in the whole wide world.

151
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,700
No other place got this whitefish but me.

152
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,900
Yeah, I'm sure it is,

153
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,200
but I'm more of a, you know, pastrami...

154
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,700
corned-beef kinda guy.

155
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,800
Can I get a pastrami corned-beef thing ?

156
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,300
You are the whitefish sable. Period.

157
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,700
What do you want me to do ?

158
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,800
- What about tong ?
- No tong !

159
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,900
Hey let me ask you this ok ?

160
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,700
What if I got somebody to switch sandwiches with me ?

161
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,700
- To switch with you ?
- Yeah maybe, you know uh...

162
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
Ted Danson or something...

163
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,100
What do you think about that ?

164
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,100
Okay, I tell you what I'm going to do for you...

165
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,700
If the Mr. Danson say Ok

166
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,300
Okay to switch !

167
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,200
- Alright thanks.
- If I can do it, I can do it.

168
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
- I see you at the Temple.
- Okay.

169
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,700
Jesus, that guy almost broke my hand with that shake.

170
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,200
You don't whisper to me, please don't...

171
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,700
I said he almost broke my hand with that handshaking.

172
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,700
You know, little time, once in a while,

173
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,700
if you...

174
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,700
if you're pleasant to people.

175
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,700
What's the matter ?

176
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,500
Get a drink of water.

177
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,000
Take some water !

178
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,900
It's ok, Pop !

179
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,100
I think you're gonna be alright.

180
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,600
I got your glasses.

181
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,800
Well your dad has had a mild stroke.

182
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
- Really ?
- Yes, but he's going to be fine

183
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,700
I've got him lightly sedated right now

184
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,600
and he's resting.

185
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,100
But he's doing very very well

186
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,700
and there's nothing for you to worry about.

187
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,500
- Okay.
- Absolutely !

188
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,500
My feeling is we may do a little corrective surgery

189
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,600
I don't know exactly when

190
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,200
but we'll have him here for a while.

191
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,900
- It's much better
- Let me ask you a question.

192
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,900
My dad and I were eating in the deli

193
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,600
earlier and uh...

194
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Actually they named a sandwich after me...

195
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,800
- No kidding ?
- Yeah, I got my own sandwich !

196
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
- That is great !
- I'm up on the board.

197
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,500
The Larry David, if you go in there...

198
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,200
Oh I've seen that on the menu, everybody's got their sandwich.

199
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,800
Yes but you know, the bad news is that

200
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
I can't stand the sandwich between you and me.

201
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,600
- What is it ?
- I see you recoiled a little bit, was it a breath thing ?

202
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,800
- No, no, not at all.
- You put your head back a little bit.

203
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,700
- Not at all, no.
- But anyway, is it...

204
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,500
- Here's my question
- Okay

205
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,700
Is it possible that the sandwich

206
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
could have had something to do with the stroke.

207
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,900
If the sandwich was caught

208
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,900
and he started choking and couldn't breath...

209
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,300
and then became fearful, I guess it's possible.

210
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,300
He could raise his blood pressure

211
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,600
His life is not threatened, he's fine and he's resting, so...

212
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,400
The sandwich gave him a stroke.

213
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,000
How do you like this ?

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,100
The sandwich !

215
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Do you mind if I...

216
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,500
You know I'm a big fan of "Seinfeld"...

217
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,200
- I don't know if it bothers you
- Why would it bother me ?

218
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,700
- It was a wonderful show.
- Thank you...

219
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,800
I tell you what.

220
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,500
I'm gonna do your father surgery for you.

221
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,600
I'm chief sugery, usually I...

222
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
delegate it to somebody else, but...

223
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,400
I would be happy to do this for you.
- Thank you

224
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Now, you're a golfer right ?

225
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,600
I can't believe that sandwich might have been responsible for this.

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,500
I'm so sorry.

227
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,800
Whitefish...

228
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,600
Why did he have to give me whitefish ?

229
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
There are so many other sandwiches

230
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,900
Pastrami, Tuna, I would have taken tuna !

231
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Even with the mercury...

232
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,600
It stinks in here...

233
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,600
You know what, I think it's smell from the onion !

234
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,800
You want a mint ?

235
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Take a mint.

236
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,300
No mint ?

237
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
I got a whole hand full of them.

238
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
What ?

239
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
What ?

240
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
What is it ?

241
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,100
I'm a doctor ?

242
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,700
I'm a doctor ?

243
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm...

244
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
adopted ?

245
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,100
Adopted ?

246
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,100
- Did you say I'm adopted ?
- I'm sorry, I have to ask you to leave the room.

247
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
Now !

248
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,400
- Adopted, you said...
- You're gonna have to leave now.

249
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Let's go, come on, let's go !

250
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,500
I think I'm adopted, I might be adopted...

251
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,700
I think I'm adopted, I could be adopted.

252
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,100
I might be adopted...

253
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,700
- Dennis, hey !
- Where do you come from ?

254
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,700
- Upstairs...
- Upstairs ? What the...

255
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Do you mind if I stop this for a second ?

256
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,800
I have an idea, maybe it'd be more funny...

257
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,800
I suspected this a long time, I really did.

258
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,200
The only thing... the only noticeable thing I have in common with him...

259
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,200
honest to god, is my penmanship I noticed there's a similarity.

260
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,000
Isn't there something with the stroke with oxygen to his brain or something ?

261
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,800
- Come on, adopted ?
- Don't ruin this for me !

262
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,100
- I'm not trying to ruin it for you.
- Don't rain on my parade !

263
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,900
- Hey look who's here !
- Hey !

264
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,700
Hey, man !

265
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,700
Can't shake, bad fingers...

266
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,800
I'm so bummed out ! I'm awful in this.

267
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,000
- It's not you.
- I'm not funny anymore !

268
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,200
It's the writing.

269
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,100
Why are you here by the way ?

270
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,900
Oh we were just... I was at his office...

271
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Thought I'd bring him by. Told him you were filming here.

272
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,500
- He got all excited.
- Yeah, I figured I would check out the pilot.

273
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,000
I really appreciate it.

274
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,100
And uh, oh guess what ?

275
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,500
Leo's... You know...

276
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,100
- They named a sandwich after me.
- Oh you're kidding me ?

277
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,000
- Oh you're kidding, that's great !
- I have a sandwich !

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,400
- That's wonderful man !
- I'm on the board.

279
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,600
- You've arrived.
- I'm on the board !

280
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
- That is fantastic, that's good news.
- Yep, so...

281
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,200
The thing about is I was wondering...

282
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
cause I know you don't go in there very much, I'm in there all the time.

283
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm in there three times a week.

284
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,600
And in as much as you don't go in there.

285
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,500
I was juste thinking that maybe...

286
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,300
cause my sandwich is a great sandwich,

287
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,200
but I'm not really a fish guy.

288
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,200
And it's kind of a... you gotta like fish... you know...

289
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,000
You like fish, but anyway...

290
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So I was thinking maybe, you wouldn't mind switching with me.

291
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,700
- Switching sandwiches ?
- Yeah, you know, cause you don't go in there

292
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,000
I'd like to eat my own sandwich, it would be fun

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
to go in with my dad, and eat my own sandwich, you know...

294
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,000
All right, what the hell, I mean what's the harm ?

295
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,300
- Really ?
- Yeah, why not ?

296
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,700
Well, Ted... Fantastic !

297
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,500
Just, if anyone ask me, what's in my new sandwich ?

298
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,600
Oh, okay, it's uh...

299
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,500
you got whitefish

300
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,100
you know whitefish ?

301
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,100
- Whitefish ?
- Whitefish and sable

302
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,200
What is sable ?

303
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,400
- Sable ? It's a fish.
- It's like the whitefish, it's a smoked fish.

304
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,600
Smoked fish, yeah...

305
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,300
- You have two fishes in the sandwich ?
- Yeah but they blend very well together.

306
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,600
They're like siamese twins, whitefish and sable...

307
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
What else is in it ? No condiments ?

308
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,100
Cream cheese...

309
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,300
Yeah some cream cheese that's...

310
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,500
Capers...

311
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,300
There may be some capers I'm not sure,

312
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,200
if you don't like'em you can brush'em off, that's not a big deal.

313
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,500
Onions...

314
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,900
That sounds awful !

315
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,300
What are you talking about, awful ?

316
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,300
My sandwich is turkey, coleslaw, russian dressing

317
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,500
It's a classic.

318
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,500
- People come in, they order a Ted Danson
- Yeah, but you're not there...

319
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,600
- you don't go in there.
- I know

320
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,900
but people ared used to my sandwich

321
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,600
They show up and all of a sudden they're eating, you know...

322
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,800
the Ted Danson sandwich all of a sudden has herring and lox...

323
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,200
- It's not herring, it's not herring
- Capers... Onions...

324
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Shut the fuck up ! It's not herring ! Ok ?

325
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,900
It's whitefish and sable, that's not herring

326
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,900
Instead of ordering a Ted Danson, people go and order a Larry David

327
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,400
What's the difference ?

328
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,300
One tastes good and one sucks !

329
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,200
Why don't you taste it ? Taste the sandwich !

330
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
- Taste it !
- I don't wanna taste it, it's...

331
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,000
- You can't even taste it ?
- I don't wanna taste it !

332
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,900
- You won't taste it ?
- No I won't taste your stupid sandwich !

333
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,300
- No I won't !
- Oh so you're not tasting it...

334
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Tickets, tickets ? Who needs...

335
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Who needs tickets ?

336
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Tickets ?

337
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Happy new year.

338
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Tickets ?

339
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,300
- How are you ?
- Good.

340
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,800
- You need tickets ?
- You got something ?

341
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,300
- Do I have... ? I have the best seats.
- Yeah ?

342
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,000
I have fabulous two seats, right down front.

343
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,800
The cantor will be practically spitting all over you.

344
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Really ?

345
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,300
How much ?

346
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,600
Give me $600 for the two.

347
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
- I'll give you $300 for the pair.
- I'll take $300.

348
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,600
I'll take the $300...

349
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,500
You have no idea what a deal this is.

350
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Incredible deal you got here.

351
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,500
- Here you are.
- All right.

352
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,400
- You're not screwing me ?
- You're screwing me maybe.

353
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,900
I'm giving you the deal of a lifetime.

354
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,800
- Oh, got them !
- All good.

355
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,200
- All right !
- Got them.

356
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
How much ?

357
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Really ?

358
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,300
Oh, jeez.

359
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,600
I don't understand why you buy tickets.

360
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,200
- It's a very popular day. 
- Too many jews to go around.

361
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
It's not enough, exactly.

362
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,200
By the way, thank you for carpooling with us.

363
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,600
I really never expected you'd get in my car again after the other night.

364
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,300
We're sorry about that.

365
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,600
Listen, this adoption thing, I was thinking about.

366
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,400
Isn't there an aunt or an uncle or somebody from your childhood ?

367
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
Any relative who would know, they're all dead.

368
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,200
- They're all dead ? Every last one ?
- All dead.

369
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,600
There's one person though.

370
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I had a nanny when I was...

371
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,100
- You had a nanny ?
- I had a nanny, Johanna Seiderman.

372
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,100
- Yeah ? 
- When I was a little kid.

373
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,600
Antoinette tracked her down.

374
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,000
There's a Johanna Seiderman in a nursing home

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,700
- in Queens...
- Really ?

376
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,200
And I've written her a letter.

377
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,500
This is terrific. That way you'll have definitive "yes, no."

378
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
You might not be happy with the answer, but you'll know the answer.

379
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,200
Let me ask you guys a question.

380
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,800
You pick up the phone during sex ?

381
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,900
Why would you pick up ?

382
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,400
You're in the middle of an intimate moment with your loved one.

383
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
- You're gonna pick up ?
- Well, I... Yeah...

384
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,700
- fine.
- Why would you pick up ?

385
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,700
If every blue moon I have sex, I'm not gonna pick up.

386
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,700
You have an answering machine,

387
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,600
- why do you have an answering machine ?
- Thank you.

388
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,100
You're having an intimate moment and you pick up the phone ?

389
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,000
Who does that ?

390
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,500
Hey, Larry.

391
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Larry, Rob.

392
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,800
Oh, sorry I can't shake, Rob.

393
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,800
- Got a bad... a bad hand, somebody...
- Okay. All right.

394
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
- So this your wife ?
- No ! What ? No !

395
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
- What kind of response is that ?
- No, that's my wife.

396
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Hey, I'll see you inside.

397
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,100
- Okay, see you inside.
- All right, take care.

398
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,900
- Really ! It's always a thing.
- Sorry ? What ? Oh, stop.

399
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,300
"No no no no !"

400
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,100
Well, you know, you've got your Al Capone hat on.

401
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,900
This happens to be a very expensive hat, mister.

402
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,500
- It's rude.
- Let's go in and pray.

403
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Ok, let's go in and pray.

404
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,500
Sorry, Susie.

405
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,200
"Be among those who cherish truth above ease.

406
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,500
Their fruit we eat now;

407
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,900
Their essence remains for us

408
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,900
in the life to come.

409
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
- How'd you get that sandwich ?
- What are you talking about ?

410
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
That sandwich at the deli !

411
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,300
Leo gave it to me. That's how I got it.

412
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,000
How do you... Did you bribe him ?

413
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,600
I bribed him. That's rich.

414
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,900
What the hell are you talking about ?

415
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,100
- How many times a week do you go ?
- I don't know. Two ?

416
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
- I go there five times a week.
- Big deal.

417
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,600
But I eat anything off the menu.

418
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,400
- I eat a lot of stuff too.
- I take stuff out.

419
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,100
- I get deliveries.
- I give it to charity.

420
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,000
Big deal !

421
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,100
What were you talking to him outside ? I saw you talking to him...

422
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,400
- None of your business.
- What was that about ?

423
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
The new year, the new year...

424
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
"Would you tell me why I didn't get a sandwich, Leo."

425
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,400
- Your sandwich stinks by the way. It stinks !
- "I wanna get a sandwich, Leo !"

426
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,900
You stink.

427
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,600
Excuse me, sir.

428
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,900
I'm gonna need to see your ticket.

429
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,800
Why ?

430
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Your ticket, sir.

431
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Is there a problem ? What's the problem ?

432
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,000
This the guy ?

433
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,200
- Okay, pal.
- You little snitch.

434
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,100
- You're gonna have to step out of there.
- Why ? I have a ticket.

435
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,200
- I can't believe it !
- Do you feel like making a scene ?

436
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
- No.
- Shh !

437
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,700
- Oh, shush you.
- Shh !

438
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Shush yourself !

439
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,200
All right, great. Little tattletale.

440
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,400
You little nitch.

441
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,100
He spilled the coffee, by the way, 'cause I couldn't put my fingers through your dainty cup !

442
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,400
You're setting a very bad example for my gentile wife.

443
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,600
You know that ? Look It's her first time in temple.

444
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,100
- Larry, what's happening ?
- They're kicking us out.

445
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,500
- Well, are you gonna wait for us ?
- It's gonna be an hour and a half.

446
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,400
How are we gonna get home ? We carpooled with you.

447
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,500
You'll get a ride. There's plenty of people. Ask somebody...

448
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Let's go.

449
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Get a ride.

450
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Friends, let us continue on page 143.

451
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,000
- I saw you roll about seven feet past.
- Yeah.

452
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,600
Get this: The doctor divorced his wife and is seeing his secretary.

453
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
- Just told me.
- Unbelievable.

454
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
This guy...

455
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
Did you hear from the nanny ?

456
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
No, not yet.

457
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,500
- You must be on pins and needles.
- Yeah.

458
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,800
But you know I think if she gets the letter,

459
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,400
I think she's gonna get in touch with me.

460
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,700
I don't know, we'll see.

461
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,200
- That's wild.
- Isn't it ?

462
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,000
He's got the yips.

463
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,100
The what ?

464
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
The yips.

465
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,700
- The yips !
- Yeah well, I don't know what that is.

466
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,300
- You never heard of the yips ?
- No.

467
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Okay, it's in golf.

468
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,200
You line up to putt and your hands shake.

469
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,600
He was shaking like this.

470
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,100
Well...

471
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,700
I mean, maybe it's just a golf condition.

472
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
He gets nervous when he putts or something.

473
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,300
I can't take that chance. He's operating on my father.

474
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,500
You need to call him and tell him not to do it.

475
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,000
They're gonna have to get somebody else.

476
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
- I hate doing stuff like this.
- You don't have a choice.

477
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
I hate these calls.

478
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Pick up the phone and call the doctor.

479
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,100
Maybe you could call him.

480
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,100
If it was my father I would've already been on the phone.

481
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,100
You should go out of the room 'cause I can't do this in front of somebody else,

482
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,000
honest to go could you leave the room ?

483
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,300
It's like calling for a date or something,

484
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,300
- you know, I need privacy.
- Oy.

485
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
I never...

486
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,500
- I never said you were adopted.
- Yeah, that's what you said.

487
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,000
No, I never said that.

488
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,600
I wouldn't say that to you, no.

489
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,100
It's not true, no.

490
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,700
- You're not adopted.
- It's okay, you can tell me. I can take it.

491
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,900
- You're not, you're not.
- Are you sure ?

492
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,900
Listen, that Larry David sandwich,

493
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,400
I didn't finish it.

494
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,900
I remember seeing a half a sandwich still on that table.

495
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,600
You want the other half ?

496
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,500
You know what, I just ran into your doctor.

497
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,100
I'm meeting him there for lunch.

498
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,100
- What a nightmare that's gonna be.
- What ?

499
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,900
You sure I'm not adopted ?

500
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,600
I never said that.

501
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,100
Never.

502
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Okay.

503
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,100
We'll see what Mrs. Seiderman has to say.

504
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,800
I'd like a Larry David to go, please.

505
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Oh, we don't have that sandwich anymore.

506
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,200
- What ?
- They changed the name.

507
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,300
And I say that it happens every single time.

508
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
I swear to god.

509
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
No I've never lied to you, not to you guys.

510
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,000
Larry, what are you doing here ?

511
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,800
You stole my sandwich ? Is that what you did ?

512
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,400
- The hell are you talking about ?
- What am I talking about ?

513
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,100
What are you talking about ?

514
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,500
- You stole my sandwich !
- What the fuck does that mean ?

515
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Look, look !

516
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
- Look at the board !
- Are you blaming me ?

517
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,900
- I saw you talking to him outside the temple.
- You're out of your fucking mind.

518
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,600
- You don't think I saw who you were talking to ?
- You're losing it !

519
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,100
I always talk to people outside.

520
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,600
It's Rosh Hashanah ! It's the new year !

521
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,300
I talk to deli owners ! I talk to pawnbrokers !

522
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,300
"Leo, can I please have a sandwich ?"

523
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,400
- Oh, bullshit !
- "Please, please !"

524
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,500
You were so jealous that I had a sandwich, up there

525
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,200
and you just couldn't take it, could you ?

526
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,100
You had to get your little sandwich !

527
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,600
- I got a piece of information you might be interested in.
- I can't wait. What is it ?

528
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,300
I'm adopted.

529
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,900
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit ? Bullshit ?

530
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,100
No, it's not bullshit.

531
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,600
What do you mean you're adopted ?

532
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm adopted.

533
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,300
How do you know ?

534
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,000
My father told me.

535
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,300
You don't know who your parents are ?

536
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,600
I know they're not those nuts ! I know that !

537
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,900
- But I know who yours are.
- Fuck.

538
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,100
Enjoy your whitefish. Enjoy.

539
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
- Larry.
- Yeah ?

540
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,700
Larry, you are adopted ?

541
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,400
- Yeah.
- I adopted too ! You are my brother !

542
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,400
We are in the brotherhood of the adopted !

543
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,300
Larry, come on over here.

544
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,800
You know what I'm going to do ?

545
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,000
I'm going to let you have any sandwich you want.

546
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,700
- Really ?
- Yeah, any one you want ! Take it ! Go ahead, take it.

547
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,400
- Oh, boy.
- Take it.

548
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,400
- It's a tough decision.
- Okay okay, I wait.

549
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,200
I think I'm going to have to go with that Ted Danson.

550
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,300
- Ted Danson ? This yours.

551
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,000
- Thank you !
- That son of a bitch don't come in anyway !

552
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
- You got it !
- Thank you.

553
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,400
- Hey, Larry.
- Dr. Sewell.

554
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,200
I want you to meet a friend of mine. Leo, this is Dr. Sewell.

555
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
- Leo.
- How are you, Dr. Sewell ?

556
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,700
I think I'll get that Larry David to go.

557
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,000
Do not even think about it.

558
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,200
I'm expecting a call from Mrs. Seiderman.

559
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,200
- Who ?
- You know, my nanny.

560
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Do not pick up that phone.

561
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,200
Nobody's picking up.

562
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,700
I had an answer... to his question.

563
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,200
If only he had picked up.

564
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,900
Mrs. Seiderman ?

565
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,400
Mrs. Seiderman.

566
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,700
Mrs. Seiderman !

567
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,700
Mrs. Seiderman ?!

568
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,900
