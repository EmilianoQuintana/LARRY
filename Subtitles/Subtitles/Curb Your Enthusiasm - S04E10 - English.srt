00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:16,438
- Who are you?!
- l'm Leopold Bloom.

1
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,314
l'm an accountant.

2
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,319
l'm from
Whitehall & Marks.

3
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,514
l've come here
to do your books.

4
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,693
l've come here
to do your books.

5
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:30,560
Oh, Mr. Bloom.
l've been expecting you.

6
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,997
No, l've come here
to do your books.

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,764
- Oh...
- Oh. Oh...

8
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,600
- you...
- you...

9
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,004

- Oh, you have, have you?

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,908
- huh?
- Oh, you have, huh? Okay.

11
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,537
- l had it yesterday, the whole thing.
- l know.

12
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,069
We went through
the whole play,

13
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,309
l knew it. Why am l forgetting it
all of a sudden?

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,547
Maybe l should go with you
and run lines with you on the plane.

15
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,349
- No, you can't.
- lnstead of going in two days,

16
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,753
- l'll go with you.
- No, it's crazy.

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,850
- Will you run lines?
- l'll be fine. Stick to the plan.

18
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,487
You got the N.R.D.C. meeting
tomorrow, l want you to go to that.

19
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,396
The environment is a lot more important
than this show. l want you to do that.

20
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,195
- Thank you, though.
- All right.

21
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,633
What do you think of my plane outfit?
You like my plane outfit?

22
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,728
- lt looks very comfortable.
- lt's comfortable, right?

23
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,466
Who's gonna be
on the plane with you?

24
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,236
Let's see, Jeff, uh,

25
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:19,734
David Schwimmer, um,
Cady Huffman.

26
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,974
Oh.

27
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:25,451
- Cady Huffman?
- What? She plays Ulla in the show.

28
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,282
No, l know who she is.

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,120
This is how-- it's very obvious why
you don't want me to go.

30
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,489
What?
Are you nuts?

31
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,551
''And, uh, Cady Huffman.''

32
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,426
lt's like--

33
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,261
What? Come on,
she hates my guts.

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,699
l met her at Ben Stiller's party.
She couldn't stand me.

35
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,634
You better work fast,
my friend.

36
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,604
Yeah.

37
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,573
lf you're gonna cash in on this, uh,
10th anniversary gift--

38
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,405
you have, what,
three days left?

39
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,434
You have some work to do.

40
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,970
How's it going,
by the way?

41
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,380
- Has it been going well?
- lt's okay, it's--

42
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,180
l haven't really been
pushing it.

43
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,518
New York's a big place.
This is a good opportunity for you.

44
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:06,651
- Okay, don't worry about it, all right?
- Okay, yeah.

45
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,456
Oh.

46
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,962
- That's it.
- Okay.

47
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,964
So, l'll be there
opening night, okay?

48
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,125
The next time l'll see you
will be after the play,

49
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,159
- but l'll be there, so know that.
- Okay.

50
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,637
- l love you.
- l love you.

51
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,663
Bye.

52
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,467
Go get 'em.

53
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,123
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

54
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,387
No Cheryl?

55
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,986
No, she's got that
N.R.D.C. meeting.

56
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,293
- Great!
- She's not coming till--

57
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,731
- You've got three days, man.
- Yeah, nothing's--

58
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,395
Three days.
You never know.

59
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,768
Yeah, three more days...

60
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,171
- till we open too, isn't that amazing?
- Amazing.

61
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,506
- lt's the exact same day.
- You're gonna be great.

62
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,275
- Cady went to go get some coffee.
- Oh, she's here?

63
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,475
She's here, and she confided
in me something.

64
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:07,452
- What, she hates my guts?
- She has obsessive-compulsive disorder.

65
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,954
- Really?
- Yeah.

66
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,684
Cady has O.C.D?

67
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,716
l-l-l told her
that you have it, too.

68
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,427
What the--
are you nuts?

69
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,456
- What's the matter with you?
- Come on, that's funny.

70
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,368
- That's funny?
- That's really funny. She was excited.

71
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,372
- That was stupid.
- lt was not stupid.

72
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,772
Just a stupid joke to play on somebody.
Take advantage of--

73
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,673
Hey, Larry.

74
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,510
- Hi hi hi.
- Hi hi hi, oh.

75
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,209
Mmm.

76
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,377
Hey, where is
the coffee place?

77
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,217
1 23 steps that way.

78
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,416
1 23 steps l'll be taking.

79
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,550
- l'll see you in a few minutes.
- Okay.

80
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,587
Jeff told me something
about you.

81
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,156
Really?

82
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,191
That you have O.C.D.

83
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,930
lt's okay, 'cause l'm--
l have it too.

84
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,374
- lsn't that kind of great, though?
- That's unbelievable!

85
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,245
l'd give you five, but l don't want
to touch your hand.

86
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,773
- l'd have to wash it.
- Yeah, me too.

87
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,786
- lt's exhausting, isn't it?
- Ugh.

88
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,516
- The counting, the cleaning.
- Planes can drive me crazy.

89
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,319
They can really
drive me crazy.

90
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,826
That whole one bag
is devoted to soap.

91
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,521
Oh, here's David.

92
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,020
- Hey, David.
- Hey.

93
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,965
- Sorry.
- How's it going?

94
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,969
- Good, how you doing?
- Good. l'm gonna hit the lounge.

95
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,028
What is that,
The Admirals' Club?

96
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,096
Yeah.

97
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,108
- See you, Cady.
- Okay.

98
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,133
l'll see you
on the plane.

99
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,311
- Well, l'm all checked in, uh...
- Okay.

100
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,647
- Should l wait for you?
- Sure, yeah.

101
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,152
- Okay, good.
- Okay.

102
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,392
Flight attendants,

103
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,417
please prepare
for departure.

104
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,594
- Hey.
- Huh?

105
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,862
Thanks for that
O.C.D. story.

106
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,301
- We're really bonding.
- Really?

107
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,033
She looks at me
like l'm a different person now.

108
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,541
- Wow.
- l can't believe it, it's amazing.

109
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,682
Do you have
anything to read?

110
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,707
l just sit here.

111
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,212
You don't have a magazine
or a book, nothing?

112
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,553
No, l just sit.

113
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,751
How come you didn't bring
a book or a magazine?

114
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,522
l don't need one,
l like just sitting.

115
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,530
Who could sit on a plane
for five hours like that? That's crazy.

116
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,225
l can.

117
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,994
Excuse me.

118
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:53,343
Sir, could you please put your
seat in the fully upright position?

119
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,386
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yes?

120
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,392
Did he tell you
to say that?

121
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,291
- Did who tell me what?
- That guy right there.

122
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,091
Did he tell you
the seat wasn't upright?

123
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,588
l don't know what you're talking about, but
we're trying to take off.

124
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,067
l saw him talking to you.
Did he tell you my seat--

125
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,571
Sir, let me tell you what l need.
l need you to be quiet

126
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,732
and in this seat,
with the seat fully up.

127
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,004
- Okay.
- That's what l require, okay?

128
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,978
- But l saw him--
- Did you hear what l require?

129
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,412
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's all l require, ''Yes, ma'am.''

130
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,245
That's very good,
you're learning quick.

131
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,478
- But wait a second.
- Excuse me?

132
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,114
Would you mind telling me
what he said to you up there?

133
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,717
- l saw him whisper to you.
- Sir, l'm trying to get to New York.

134
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,819
- Do you want to go with me?
- Yes, l do, ma'am.

135
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,727
Then we can't talk any longer.
l got stuff to do.

136
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,164
- Okay? All right.
- Okay. Okay.

137
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,900
Hey, Schwimmer.

138
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,910
Did you tell
the stewardess

139
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,969
my seat wasn't in the upright
position?

140
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,245
No.

141
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,150
Hmm, interesting.

142
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,349
- Yeah?
- What were you talking to her about?

143
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,325
That's my business.

144
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,190
Just give me a snippet.

145
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,525
No, the discussion
l had is privileged.

146
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,827
Can you give me a hint?
What's the area?

147
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,897
What could you be talking
to a stewardess about?

148
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,465
Did you allude to me?

149
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,762
Ladies and gentlemen,

150
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,364
the captain has turned on
the ''Fasten Seatbelt'' sign.

151
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,274
lf you're up and about the cabin,
please return to your seats

152
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,939
and make sure your seatbelts
are securely fastened. Thank you.

153
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,030
Welcome to The Regency.

154
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,058
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

155
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,538

- Hi, how are you doing?
- Good.

157
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,132
Okay, all right.

158
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,716
Ah.

159
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,913
You know what?
Don't have any small bills.

160
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,513
- l'll get you later.
- Okay.

161
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,354
l detect a little
skepticism there.

162
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,360
- lt's okay.
- No no no.

163
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,157

- Tim.

164
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,993
- You're working today?
- Yes.

00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,124
l'm all over this,
all right?

166
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,225
You'll see, l'll be back.

167
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,508
Sir, the bellman will bring up

00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,777

'Cause l--

00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,257
- No, not from me. l trust you, sir.

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,308
Uh, if you're hungry

00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,503

Simply insert the card
into the slot.

187
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,388
There's a beeping,

188
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,721
Firmly apply pressure
and in you go.

189
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,749
That's fascinating.

190
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,729
Some of the amenities,

191
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,231

To turn on the water,
you go like that with your wrist

200
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,112
and the water
comes out?

201
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,123
Yes, yes.

202
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,387

00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,236
All right, excellent.

208
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,069
The floor is for standing.

Kind of complicated.

210
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,403

Okay, thank you.

211
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,643

224
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,808
The guy will wind up with more money
than me if everybody gave him a 20.

225
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,474
- Hello?
- Hey.

You know your lines. You're gonna be

00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,703
Now you need to go down

233
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,731
Can't let this

234
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,242

Yeah, we have a truck

00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,812
We have a staff that does it.
We sit in the front.

249
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,716
We groom sometimes
with scissors.

250
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,880
Horses, cats,
any animal.

251
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,014
What do you really do?
Come on.

252
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,515
He is about

256
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,624
Why are you making
that face?

257
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,829
l have a tic.
l'm going on stage with a tic.

258
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,362
You don't have a tic.
l didn't see the tic before.

259
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,636
Come on.

260
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,836
You know, it could
throw off the show.

261
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,540
Ask her what she does.

262
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,605
What do you do?

263
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,640
l'm a fellatio teacher.

264
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:09,313
- Good, very good.
- Okay, now, let's be honest here.

265
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,153
lf l had made it up would l have said, ''Ask
what she does''?

266
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,250
- l know you made it up.
- No, it's not like--

267
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,784
How much money did he
give you to say that?

268
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,696
- No, it's absolutely true.
- l'd let you find out on your own.

269
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,791
- Oh, sure, yeah.
- l am a fellatio teacher.

270
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,927

- Mmm-hmm.

271
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,869

- Yes.

272
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,100
- You have classes?
- l'm an expert.

273
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,131
l don't know how anybody
could do that without a blindfold.

274
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,872
- That's crazy.
- lt's a grotesque monster, that penis.

275
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,642
No, it is not grotesque,
don't even say that. lt's beautiful.

276
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,809
And it's sad if somebody doesn't get
to experience it, yeah.

277
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,012
Oh, dear God.

278
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,181
All right.
A little Mexicali.

279
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,193

287
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:11,080
Little Johnny

288
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:14,176
Delicious, oh-ho.

289
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,519
- So, l started teaching classes.
- Uh-huh.

290
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,751
l wrote a book.

291
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,590
l started realizing that
women were just so...

292
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,528
sort of timid about
the whole thing.

293
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,295
You okay?

294
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,393
Just the way l like it.

295
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,529
Hmm.

296
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,062
What's your favorite part
of getting a blowjob?

297
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,448
You've got some napkin
on your head still.

298
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,421
- Are you drinking that water?
- You know what?

299
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,758
That's my water.
That's my--

300
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,828
- People are eating.
- Yeah, it went down the wrong pipe.

301
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,528
How's the food?

302
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,838
Where do you live?

303
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,903
Live in the city?
Using that napkin?

304
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,915
- l think l'm gonna go.
- What?

305
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,816
Yeah, l don't feel
hungry anymore.

306
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,616
- What, really?
- l'm feeling a little sick, actually.

307
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,426
Where are you going?

308
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,332
You'll never regret this.
Thank you, Herr Liebkind.

309
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,053
That's all

310
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,753
Hey, what's up?
What's going on?

311
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,091
How much longer do you
think this is gonna go on?

312
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,589
l can't say really.

313
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,305
You know, we open
in two days.

314
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,863
You should maybe
get some sleep.

315
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,637
You want to be
refreshed, right?

316
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,134
Yes.

317
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,875
Mmm, dude, have you

326
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,926
Nobody.

Okay, hold on.

l could not turn down
that air conditioning.

334
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,089
Yeah, sometimes they just--

335
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,120
you've gotta get in there and fix it
and it'll work again.

336
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,564
- You're a pretty smart guy.
- Thank you very much.

337
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,659
l could study the rest
of my life,

338
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,671
every day, eight hours a day, l could
never do that. For the rest of my life.

339
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,173
- l'm not even kidding.
- Maybe, l don't know.

340
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,675
- Ah.

341
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,302

366
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,930
Oh, no, it's packed there.
Especially opening night.

00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,840
Okay, fine fine fine.

So, how is play practice?

00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,380
Rehearsal.
Rehearsal, yeah.

370
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,507
l call it play practice.
When l was doing ''Pippin,''

371
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,517
we stayed after school
for play practice.

372
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,519
But how is it?

373
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,613
l don't see you doing it at all,
but you'll be great!

374
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,124
- You'll be wonderful.
- Yeah, thanks.

375
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,356
- l didn't know you sang and you danced.
- l really don't.

376
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,454
- Wow!
- l don't know, Mel Brooks liked me--

377
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,432
Really?

378
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,434
Oh, my gosh,
you're a star.

379
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,197
- You're gonna be a star.
- Oh, stop it.

380
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,467
So what are you doing?
Wanna take a ride out to Westchester,

381
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,565
maybe go look
at some open houses?

382
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,576
- You're buying a house?
- No no no.

383
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,578
Open houses, you just go,
you visit, you know?

384
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,375
You just go in,
you tour around

385
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,472
pretend you're buying,
but you don't.

386
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,007
Just go drive around
to homes?

387
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,316
lf you're not buying them what's
the point? Just to look at the homes?

388
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,654
- Yes! Oh, it's beautiful--
- You know what?

389
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,023
l can't do it anyway.
l gotta study my lines.

390
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,755
- l can't do it.
- Okay.

391
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,821
- All right, sir, we're all done.
- All right.

392
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,958
- Excellent job, thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

393
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,960
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, no problem, okay.

394
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,269
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

395
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,041
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

396
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,567
Bye-bye.

397
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,480
Was l supposed
to tip that guy?

398
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,608
- The guy fixing that?
- Yeah.

399
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,143
Uh-huh. Not a lot,
but you gotta tip him.

400
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,816
Why do l have to tip him?
He's just a--

401
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,552
he came in and fixed
something.

402
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,060
He performed a service
and you tip him for a service.

403
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,686
Of course you do.

404
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,459
This whole tipping thing,
it's so confusing.

405
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,961
Good morning, Mr. David.
ls this a good time to clean up?

406
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,993
Okay, come on in.

407
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,177
Hey, let me ask you
a question.

408
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,510
- Did you find that watch on your cart?
- Yes.

409
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,515
- Really?
- Yeah.

410
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,540
l know whose watch
that is.

411
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,918
Schwimmer, hey, l hope you get
this message.

412
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,926
l found your watch.

413
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,520
You can thank me
at the meeting.

414
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,553
All right, goodbye.

415
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,595
Hey.

416
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,698
- Remember me from yesterday?
- Yeah yeah, sure.

417
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,175
Everything okay?
lt's all straightened out?

418
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,371
Straightened out what?

419
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,176
l gave the other doorman,
the heavy-set guy with the glasses...

420
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,513
- Yeah--
- l gave him $20, told him to give 10.

421
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,111
- You didn't get the $10?
- No.

422
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,121
What?

423
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,147
How you doing?
How you doing? Take care.

424
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,956
- He didn't give you any money?
- No, not a dime.

425
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,794
You sure he didn't
give you anything?

426
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,801
Yeah, l'm sure.

427
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,429
ln other words,

428
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,439
he's got the $10 now,

429
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,566
and he chose
not to give it to you.

430
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,600
- ls that what you're saying?
- No, that's what you're saying.

431
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,671
l'm saying l didn't get
$10 from him.

432
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,773
Hmm.

433
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,596
Okay.

434
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,294
All right.
Fine.

435
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,963
- Here you go.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

436
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,733
- You're welcome.
- This means a lot.

437
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,934
l'll tell you,
Sanjay over there

438
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,466
was a little upset
this morning.

439
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,911
You didn't--
you didn't take care of him.

440
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,073
Take care of him?
He's a repairman.

441
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,879
Well, yeah, but he helped you out
and you didn't--

442
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,682
He works for the hotel.
My air conditioning wasn't working.

443
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,882
l didn't have a good night's sleep.
What am l supposed to do?

444
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:07,892
Just, maybe want
a little something.

445
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,292
Can you have any kind
of conversation with you people

446
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,456
without it ending up
with a financial exchange?

447
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,864
Well, yes, but,
like l said--

448
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,835
Oh, all right.

449
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,805
Excuse me.

450
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,807
Oh, hello, sir.

451
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,809
l was talking to Tim
over there.

452
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,811
He says you were
a little upset this morning

453
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,245
that you didn't get
some kind of gratuity.

454
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,249
A little perturbed,
yeah, a little.

455
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,750
- Really?
- Yeah, sure.

456
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,048
That's your job, Sanji.

457
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,884
You know, it's just like,
''Hey, l appreciate this.''

458
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,550
Common courtesy sometimes,
''Hey, thank you.''

459
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,889
- Common courtesy, really?
- l put in the time, you know,

460
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,895
fixed the air for you.

461
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,989
- l'll tell you what l'm gonna do.
- Yeah.

462
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,660
- You know the show, ''The Producers?''
- Sure, big show.

463
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,727
l'm in the show. l'm gonna get some
tickets today, l'll give you a ticket.

464
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,363
- How about that?
- l'll take a ticket.

465
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,136
- So we're square?
- Yeah, we are, that's good karma.

466
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,507
- All right, Sanji.
- Hey, that's good. Sanjay.

467
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,104
- Sanjay.
- Thank you.

468
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,258
Excuse me, hey,
could l ask you a favor?

469
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,784
- Would you please take our photograph?
- Thank you.

470
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,558
l'm not really
very good at this stuff.

471
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,566
lt's no big deal,
it's just a point-and-click.

472
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,295
- All right.
- But you gotta turn it around.

473
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,098
- Oh, okay.
- Thank you.

474
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,935
But do it
horizontally.

475
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,203
Okay, you know what?
lt actually works

476
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,142
a lot better like this

477
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,145
'cause l get
all the background.

478
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,340
l see the buildings,
l see the signs.

479
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,111
Okay, but take it horizontally,
and if l want it vertical

480
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,415
l'll Photoshop it,
and this way l have the option.

481
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,251
- Just do it horizontally.
- l mean, if you saw what l see--

482
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,951
- l got it here. Take it horizontally.
- Maybe he's right.

483
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,256
- You get the whole city feel.
- l see the whole background.

484
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,161
- Don't do this, okay?
- John, l was just--

485
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:55,689
You are constantly undermining
every decision l've made on this trip!

486
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,430
- Sir, you know what?
- There's nothing l can do to please you

487
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,438
since you got off
the goddamn airplane!

488
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,305
Why don't you guys
work this out, okay? Seriously.

489
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,309
Oh, so no photo?

490
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,403
- So you're out, that's it?
- Yeah, l'm out.

491
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,381
- Okay, thanks.
- Excuse me, is that you?

492
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,747
That's the actor.
We just picked up our tickets.

493
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,912
- We're seeing the show tomorrow night.
- You're in the show?

494
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,922
Great, oh,
l can't wait!

495
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,924
Because you

496
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,619
will

497
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,152
fail!

498
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,340
- Where's Max Bialystock?
- Absolutely.

499
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,070
He'll be here.
He'll be here.

500
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,874
- Mel, l really--
- Hello.

501
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,848
Hi, Larry.

502
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:48,478
# Larry David and you're
dangerously near me #

503
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,546
# lt's Larry David! #
l'm so glad you're here.

504
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,559
- Hey, Norm.
- Hey, Larry, how are you doing today?

505
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,561
Susan Stroman,
the best director.

506
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,859
You are so lucky
you got her.

507
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,990
Look, l got the lenses
put in my Max glasses.

508
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,795
- Check it out.
- Great.

509
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,563
Oh, it's great.
l like it.

510
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,161
- You love that?
- Absolutely.

511
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,172
- My father wears these.
- l love them.

512
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,766
Okay, you think
they'll work.

513
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,607
l got your message, by the way.
Thank you so much.

514
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,408
- You're welcome.
- He found my watch.

515
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,074
- Oh!
- Fantastic.

516
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:20,243
l lost it yesterday sometime.
Anyway, thank you so much.

517
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,719
Oh, do you have it now?

518
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,949
- That's fantastic.
- That's a relief.

519
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,855
All during rehearsal
he was going,

520
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,326
- ''Where's my watch?''
- Did you leave it at the hotel?

521
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,295
What the hell
is going on here?

522
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,229
Are you kidding
or you really found it?

523
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,927
No, l found it
and l had it in my pocket.

524
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,333
Did you look,
maybe--

525
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,962
Remember putting it
in your pockets?

526
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,133
- l put it in this jacket pocket.
- That jacket?

527
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,267
What, you lost
the watch?

528
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:48,708
Oh gee, l guess
l lost the watch,

529
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,511
- l'm sorry.
- You lost--

530
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,245
Maybe it's in the cab.

531
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,152
lt could drop out
of the pocket.

532
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,587
- Did you take your jacket off?
- No.

533
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,614
l'm just trying
to comprehend this.

534
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,560
You lost my watch
that you had

535
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,790
less than an hour ago
in your hands, correct?

536
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,094
Yeah, sorry.

537
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,567
Well, you owe me
a watch.

538
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,799
What are you, nuts? You didn't
even have a watch to begin with,

539
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,705
so you're in the same position.
There's no change.

540
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,404
lt's a little different. You had
my watch and now you don't.

541
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,310
He's right, the watch
was lost,

542
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,076
so it continues
to be lost.

543
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,948
- What can l say?
- You can say-- you can say,

544
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,078
''l'm sorry,
and l'll buy you a new watch.''

545
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,849
- Buy you a new watch?!
- Yeah.

546
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,414
lt was a lost watch.

547
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,188
- You didn't have the watch, right?
- Absolutely, no.

548
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,195
He found the watch,
so he had the watch.

549
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,163
- Yes.
- The watch was there. He had it.

550
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,530
- David lost the watch.
- David lost the watch.

551
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,798
Who found the watch?
Why is David this upset now?

552
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,237
l don't know why
David's this upset now.

553
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,572
- Because it's not your watch.
- He did not intentionally lose it!

554
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,908
No, 'cause he lost
it first, maybe he should--

555
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,971
- Possession is 9/10ths--
- lf the watch had never been lost--

556
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,848
Hey hey, all right!
All right! All right!

557
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,875
We must go on here.
We have a show to do.

558
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,616
Max and Leo have got
to get along.

559
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,955
The whole point of the show
is that Max and Leo love each other.

560
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:11,588
That's the success
of this musical, is that journey,

561
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,258
that you not only become
successful producers,

562
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,267
you become
wonderful friends.

563
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,293
Now, we can't let what has happened here
come into this show.

564
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,669
- She's right.
- You don't have to worry about me.

565
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,038
- What are you doing?
- l'm just arranging--

566
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,543
lt looks like you're building
a sandcastle on the table.

567
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,671
Let's start to read.

568
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,681
Now, fellas,

569
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,206
the one thing l wanted to talk about
was that opening scene.

570
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,709
Oh, you know what? l just gotta wash
my hands. l'll be right back.

571
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,123
l don't know,
we need to get started.

572
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,955
Have you noticed?

573
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,223
Have you noticed him
doing stuff like this?

574
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,924
He's compulsive
beyond belief.

575
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,195
Some people get nervous,
they wash their hands.

576
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,997
lt's a quirk,
it's a quirk.

577
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,027
You know,
people have quirks.

578
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,062
Okay.

579
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,209
All right, so now
about that first scene,

580
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,305
the thing is, you have to drive
that scene forward.

581
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,179
- Larry?
- Yeah.

582
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,047
So you've got
to pick up the cues.

583
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,713
All right, why don't we
go to page nine in the script,

584
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,745
see if we can
get started here?

585
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,329
lt's not like l lost it
on purpose, did l?

586
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,558
l know, he's like
a little crazy or something.

587
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,089
Did l take his watch and throw it
in the river or something?

588
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,227
l mean, of course
l wanted to keep the watch.

589
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,170
- l was excited l got it for him!
- l know.

590
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,934
l didn't
understand that.

591
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,703
- That's so crazy.
- So crazy. So crazy.

592
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,872
Larry!

593
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,437
Oh!

594
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,660
# Opening night #

595
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,897
# lt's opening night! #

596
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,861
l don't know what l was thinking!
l can't do this!

597
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,872
Nathan, l'm crazy!
Why did l--

598
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,170
Stop it! Just stop it!
l said stop it!

599
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,836
Now stand up!

600
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,778
Take this
and go out there!

601
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,476
You can do it!

602
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,484
Don't even
look back!

603
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,247
Oy.

604
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,434
- Hey.
- You wanna go over there?

605
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,528
- What, to the theater?
- Yeah.

606
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,507
Are you cra-- we've got like,
an hour and a half.

607
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,839
l thought l'd get there
a little earlier.

608
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,845
No, l'm gonna do
some stretching.

609
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,370
- All right.
- You do any kind of warm-up?

610
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,781
Warm-up?

611
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,547
- Like what? What do you mean?
- Like stretching.

612
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,351
- Stretching?
- Never mind.

613
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,880
Hey, what about--

614
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:03,359
how do you feel about reimbursing me
for the watch?

615
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,625
lt seems to me
your watch was missing.

616
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,359
l mean, we've gone
over this,

617
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,765
but if l didn't find your watch
in the first place,

618
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,669
- then it's not mine to lose.
- Who had it last?

619
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,105
You're in the same position
now as when l started...

620
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,734
- Who had it last?
- ...so why am l getting blamed for it?

621
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,767
- l mean, you had it.
- You lost your watch.

622
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,838
- Let's not. We have a show to do.
- Okay, fine.

623
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,873
- By the way.
- Yeah?

624
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,112
You did tell the stewardess
that my seat

625
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:31,121
- wasn't in the upright position, right?
- Okay, l'll see you.

626
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,701
Larry David.

627
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,678
- Hi!
- l'm a nervous wreck.

628
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:57,476
Oh no, this'll be exciting.
You're gonna be great!

629
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:00,143
l'm gonna destroy your entire show,
don't you understand?

630
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,209
You're doing a great job.
They're gonna love you.

631
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,619
- You're gonna get out there--
- Why are they gonna love me?

632
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,556
- People dislike me intensely.
- 'Cause you're great!

633
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,183
The audience is not
gonna love me.

634
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,956
Yes they are. Mel never would
have let you do the show.

635
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,792
What are you doing
here so early?

636
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,321
l have to get here early
every single night.

637
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,197
l do have rituals.

638
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,363
- Oh, you've got some O.C.D. stuff.
- Yeah, lots of them.

639
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:24,034
- What do you got?
- Oh God, pacing, petal counting.

640
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,703
l think l'm gonna bang my head
against the wall, maybe 50 times.

641
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,575
- You don't want to do that.
- No, l do.

642
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,911
'Cause my mother used to say
that to me growing up.

643
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,850
''Go bang your head against the wall,''
and l took it literally.

644
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,750
l did. l used to bang
it against the wall.

645
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:39,120
That's why l got this condition in the first
place, listening to my mother.

646
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,887
Thank you, by the way.
That was so sweet of you,

647
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,985
with the guy with the handbag.
That was dangerous.

648
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,655
That was really
dangerous!

649
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,187
- l didn't think so.
- Oh.

650
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,028
- Honestly.
- No, you're so sweet.

651
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,331
You know, l didn't even
think twice about it.

652
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,463
Honest to God.
The right thing to do.

653
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,905
Well, thanks.
That doesn't happen much.

654
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:00,377
lf l didn't go into show business,
l was going to become a fireman.

655
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,811
- Hmm.
- All right.

656
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,287
l've been thinking
about that

657
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,380
10th anniversary
present of yours.

658
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,922
You wanna come in?

659
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,396
Sure.

660
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,227
Close the door.

661
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,012
What is that?

662
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,014
- What is that?

00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,420
You've got a picture of Bush
in your dressing room?

00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,451
Yeah.

667
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,005
You're a Republican?

00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,134
Yes, Larry,

669
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,836
Ugh.

671
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,222
A picture of Bush,

672
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,318
l'd fuck her
with a Bush mask on!

673
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:27,024
You think these glasses are okay?
l think l made a mistake.

674
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,465

in this costume,

675
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,468

Are you crazy? l've got my costume on,

The ticket, they don't have it

Shit, do me a favor,

686
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,234

690
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,381

693
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,783
How would l know
to ask your name?

694
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:31,226
You said they'd be under my name.
Honest to God!

695
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,991
Excuse me, l'm sorry.
Excuse me.

700
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,900

Okay, l'm sorry

What are you doing
in the lobby

722
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,796
20 minutes before the show
fighting with a Sikh?

723
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,308
lt's too long a story,
l gotta get out of here.

724

Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.

How did it go?
How did the anniversary gift go?

728
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,913
Did you cash in?
Oh!

729
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,924
- Alas, l did not.

But l'll still have an hour

731
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,616
- Okay, yeah.
- So don't count me out yet.

732
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,253
No no, you still

Okay, you should

739
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,725
- Huh? Look a little familiar?
- Give me.

740
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,099
Where did you--
how, what happened?

741
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,730
One of the maintenance guys
from the hotel had it on.

742
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,865
Out in the lobby.
l had to wrestle him for it.

743
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,705
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

Hey, let me ask you

- All water under the bridge, right?
- Yeah yeah yeah.

750
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,588
Just for my own
edification...

751
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,429
what did you say
to that stewardess?

752
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,233
Did you tell her about the seat not
being upright?

753
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,608
What?

754
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,337
You're really something.

- Uh...

# Once he was a king... #

832
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:09,645
You've all heard
of theater in the round?

833
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,781
You're looking at the man
who invented theater in the square.

834
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,347
Nobody had
a good seat!

835
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,827
# King of old
Broadway... #

836
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,796
l spent my entire life
in the theater.

837
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:24,130
l was a protg of the great
Boris Thomaschefsky.

838
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,906
Yes, he taught me
everything l know.

839
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,908
l'll never forget.

840
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,069
He turned to me
on his deathbed

841
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,079
and said,
''Maxella...''

842
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,555
What does that mean?

843
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:48,422
l don't know,
l don't speak Yiddish.

844
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,450
Strangely enough,
neither did he.

845
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,596
ln my heart l knew
what he was saying.

846
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,827
He was saying,
''When you're down and out

847
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,631
and everybody thinks
you're finished,

848
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,867
that's the time to stand
on your two feet and shout,

849
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:05,397
'Who do you gotta fuck
to get a break in this town?'''

850
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:23,986
# Fame is in my sights
again #

851
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,723
# l take those fancy
flights again #

852
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:29,130
# l'm gonna scale
the heights again #

853
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,897
# Bialystock will
never drop #

854
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:36,633
# Bialystock will
never stop #

855
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:41,543
# Bialystock will be
on top again #

856
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:44,775
# Fame is in his sights again,
he'll take those fancy flights again #

857
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,646
# He's gonna scale
the heights again #

858
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,710
# He'll be on top again,
hey! #

859
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,158
Hello?

860
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,434
Anybody here?

861
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,444
Mr. Bialystock?

862
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,613
Who are you?
What do you want?

863
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,116
What are you
doing here?

864
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,983
Speak to me,
dummy, speak!

865
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,612
Why don't you speak?

866
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,021
Scared, can't talk.

867
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,021
All right, calm down.

868
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,051
Relax, get ahold
of yourself.

869
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,055
Take a deep breath.

870
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,091
Ahh.

871
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,504
Who are you?

872
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,836
l'm Leopold Bloom.
l'm an accountant.

873
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,341
l'm from
Whitehall & Marks.

874
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,775
l've come here
to do your books.

875
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,211
Oh, you have,
have you?

876
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:54,684
Now, let's see.

877
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:57,846
lf we add these
deductions, we get...

878
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,450
Oh, it's absolutely
amazing,

879
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,585
but under the right
circumstances

880
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:06,289
a producer could make
more money with a flop

881
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,560
than he could
with a hit!

882
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,968
Yes, it's quite
possible.

883
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:14,527
lf he were certain
that the show would fail,

884
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,539
a man could make
a fortune!

885
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,507
Yes?

886
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,477
- Yes what?
- What you were saying.

887
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,537
- Keep talking.
- What was l saying?

888
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,141
You were saying that under
the right circumstances--

889
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:37,183
you were saying...

890
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:43,526
that under the right
circumstances--

891
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,561
What was l saying?

892
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:52,074
That under the right
circumstances--

893
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:56,705
Under the right
circumstances,

894
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,908
what?

895
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,782
That's the question.

896
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,810
What?

897
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,029
Boy, you got a nice

898
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,691
healthy head of hair there,
you know that? Look at that!

899
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:17,723
lt's like a pelt!

900
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,436
Uh...

901
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:26,874
l didn't really get the good shave today,
you know?

902
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,401
l don't know why,
l'm an excellent shaver.

903
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,414
Feel this cheek, Bloom.
Feel that cheek.

904
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:34,781
lt's like a tush.
ls that not a tush?

905
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:37,787
l got a tushy cheek.

906
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:39,880
- Um, it's--
- Boy oh boy.

907
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,948
Please, Mr. Bialystock,

908
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,222
um, l've discovered

909
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,491
that a man...

910
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,294
could make more money
with a flop

911
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,198
than he could
with a hit.

912
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,829
Does that bring
any scheme to mind?

913
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,138
Yeah.

914
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,644
- Ever play this game?
- l'm sorry.

915
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:04,044
- You don't come to theater with a hat.
- Never did that one?

916
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,549
- No.
- You don't wear a hat to the theater.

917
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,551
- lt's not a hat, sir.
- Take your hat off!

918
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,849
- l won't take my turban off!
- l can't see!

919
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,879
lt's not my fault,
he gave me the tickets.

920
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:15,391
- Calm down and try to watch.
- No! No!

921
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:18,553
- Fine, watch!
- You're disturbing everybody.

922
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:21,758
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is my cousin Andy.

923
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:23,823
lt may come as no surprise
to you to learn

924
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,097
that he is the product
of incest.

925
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,173
Of course, among friends
and relatives,

926
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,505
Andy is known by his
affectionate nickname--

927
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,602
The Primary Reason
for Anti-Semitism.

928
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,481
Unfortunately,
l know from experience

929
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,916
the only way we're going to get him
to calm down

930
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,443
is to put a Swanson
frozen dinner on his lap.

931
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,955
Wait, let's go back.

932
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,456
- Yeah, let's go.
- This is funny.

933
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:51,120
l know he's quite partial
to the Salisbury steak.

934
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,129
You know, there might be
an upside

935
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,131
to this whole
experience,

936
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:58,225
because if any of you are looking
for an apartment in New York--

937
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,236
and l know they're
very hard to find--

938
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,795
Andy is subletting
his mouth.

939
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,774
There's a lot
of room in there.

940
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:08,175
A lot of room.

941
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:11,009
l know there was
a Taliban living in there,

942
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,745
but he left and he's now
renting some space

943
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,413
under the Sikh's turban.

944
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,754
But the turban,

945
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,885
it has all kinds of practical
applications.

946
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:26,862
lt's a tourniquet,

947
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,661
it makes
a lovely sash.

948
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,668
Say you want to have
an impromptu game

949
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,169
of Pin the Tail
on the Donkey,

950
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:35,194
you've got
a blindfold.

951
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:39,872
All right,
what was l saying?

952
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,901
What was l saying?

953
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,406
What was l saying?

954
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,317
You were saying...

955
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:56,292
that under the right
circumstances,

956
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,693
a producer could make
more with a flop

957
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,858
- than he could with a hit.
- lt's quite possible.

958
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,959
Yes, you keep saying that,
but you don't say how.

959
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,971
Well, it's simply a matter
of creative accounting.

960
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,635
Let's assume for a moment
that you are a dishonest man.

961
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,702
Assume away.

962
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:20,681
Did you see the look
on their faces

963
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:24,619
when Larry David forgot
every line he had?

964
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:26,622
He went up,
up in smoke!

965
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:29,284
Oh, God, l'm so glad.
l'm so thankful!

966
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,817
Thank God that this damn play
is going to be over.

967
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,057
- We're going to get our lives back.
- He has freed us

968
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:36,588
from the anchor, from the albatross
of ''The Producers.''

969
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,601
- Right, right.
- Which has invaded our lives

970
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,865
every single minute,
every hour of every day!

971
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:43,464
- Trapping us!
- No more openings in Cleveland!

972
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,805
No more sleeping in dirty
beds in Pittsburgh!

973
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,810
We're free,
free at last!

974
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,778
- l know.
- lsn't it wonderful?

975
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,680
How did you know
that he could ruin the show? How?

976
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,684
The minute
l laid eyes on him,

977
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,686
l said, ''This guy
is a disaster.

978
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,688
He's a living--
he's a storm.

979
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,520
He's like a storm that will destroy
everything in its path.''

980
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,753
l mean, he's got
this gift.

981
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,955
Everything he touches,
he dooms.

982
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:08,191
He's a little cyclone,
a little tornado

983
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,324
- destroying the St. James Theater.
- l know!

984
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,733
Any minute now
the show will be dead.

985
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,737
Here, a toast!

986
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:17,467
To the death
of ''The Producers.''

987
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:20,135
May it rest in peace.

988
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:26,145
lnnkeeper, innkeeper!
Another round of drinks here!

989
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:28,151
As a matter of fact,

990
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:31,814
another round of drinks
for everybody in the place.

991
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,915
Here's to failure!

992
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:38,519
Oh, thank you.
That's very kind of you.

993
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:43,960
Partners, Leo.

994
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,467
All the way.

995
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:48,437
And nothing or no one
will ever come between us.

996
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:49,939
Nothing or no one,
Max!

997
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,136
Come in.

998
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,075
Bialystock and Bloom?

999
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,539
What?

1000
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,711
Excuse me.

1001
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:05,778
Swedish.

1002
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,888
Costing today?

1003
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:11,723
Costing?

1004
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,956
Cost--

1005
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:16,397
Oh, casting!

1006
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,568
No, l'm sorry, miss.

1007
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:22,538
- There's no casting today--
- Uh, actually,

1008
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:25,370
there very well could be casting today.
Come in, come in.

1009
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,413
Aw, fuck!

1010
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,713
- # Honeymoon #
- # Honeymoon, honeymoon #

1011
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:38,881
- # Keep a-shining in June #
- # Keep a-shining in June #

1012
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,948
# Your silvery beams
will bring love dreams #

1013
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,426
# We'll be cuddling soon #

1014
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,019
- # Ra, ta-ta, ta-ta #
- Take me out!

1015
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:49,623
# By the silvery moon. #

1016
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,699
lt's intermission.
Quick, hide your faces.

1017
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,735
They'll tear us
to pieces.

1018
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,418
- l'll have a Manhattan.
- Two whiskey sours.

1019
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:13,115
So far this is about the funniest thing
l've seen on Broadway.

1020
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,920
- l've never laughed so hard in my life.
- Absolutely hysterical.

1021
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,792
l thought
l'd split my sides.

1022
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:23,198
Honey, don't panic. There are
a lot of shows on this street.

1023
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,862
They may not necessarily be talking about
Larry David and ''The Producers.''

1024
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:29,463
Who would have guessed
Larry David would be so hysterical?

1025
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,133
Let's get back.

1026
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,369
lf he's as brilliant in the second act
as in the first,

1027
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,311
this show's gonna run
for another five years!

1028
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:41,951
l've got to think.
l've got to think.

1029
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,385
No way out.

1030
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,389
No way out.

1031
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:49,449
- No way out.
- Honey.

1032
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:51,153
- No way out.
- Listen.

1033
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:53,958
- No way out.
- Honey, listen,

1034
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:55,965
this is a small portion
of the audience.

1035
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:59,059
Let's go back and see what
the majority has to say.

1036
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,967
- The majority?
- Yes.

1037
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,665
- Sure, let's go.
- The majority, come on.

1038
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,674
Let's hear from
the majority.

1039
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,938
Let's hear
from the majority.

1040
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:09,172
Yes, we'll hear
from the majority.

1041
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:18,480
- This is the majority?
- This is the majority.

1042
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,141
# Leo and Max #

1043
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,268
# Up off our backs #

1044
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:45,042
# Back on the Great
White Way #

1045
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:46,981

# We're back on top

# So when we take
your money, never fear #

1049
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:59,888
# We'll knock Broadway
right on its ear #

1050
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,692
# The cast is great,
the script is swell #

1051
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,631
# But this we're
telling you, sirs #

1052
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,794
# lt's just no go,
you've got no show #

1053
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:08,531
# Without the producers #

1054
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:15,144
# We'll never quit #

1055
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,373
# Hit after hit #

1056
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,881
# You and me-o #

1057

# We guarantee-o #

1058

# You're looking
at Leo and Max #

1059
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,294
# The producers #

1060
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:45,673
# Leo and Max #

1061
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:48,200
