1
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:19,989
Didn't think I was
gonna find out, huh?

2
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:22,695
Is that what
you thought?

3
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:24,931
If you were me,

4
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:27,565
you wouldn't have found out
'cause you're stupid.

5
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:29,802
You guys are
fucking stupid.

6
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:31,970
- I have a gambling problem.
- A gambling problem?

7
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:35,539
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

8
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:40,980
Got a little
greedy?!

9
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:44,354
- I'm sorry, boss.
- You're sorry, you're sorry!

10
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:46,382
I'm sorry!

11
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:51,090
I'm fucking sorry, 'cause you fucking
morons fucked up!

12
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:53,361
You're sorry!

13
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:57,569
Here, you want the money?
Is that what you want?

14
00:00:57,604 --> 00:00:59,697
You want money,
you fucking idiots?

15
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,106
Here, take the money.
Here, go ahead!

16
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:05,305
Go ahead, take the fucking money!
You fucking idiots!

17
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:07,643
Take it, take it,
take the fucking money!

18
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,649
Here, take it. Is that what you want?!
Take the fucking...

19
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:11,708
come here, you
fucking cocksucker.

20
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:13,879
- I'm scared of heights, boss.
- And cut!

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,115
Cut!

22
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:18,317
Larry?
All right...

23
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:19,985
the still photographer
was right in my way.

24
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:21,618
- Huh?
- The video went in and out.

25
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:23,526
It broke off... please,
take care of the video

26
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:25,360
for me, Joe, because
I can't see the thing.

27
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:28,129
From what I could tell,
from what I could hear...

28
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:30,363
From what you could tell?
You missed the whole tape?

29
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:33,635
Oh, no, it's great...
he needs more money.

30
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:36,506
- This isn't enough, I need more money.
- He needs more money.

31
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:38,636
Every take I don't
have enough money.

32
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:40,111
- Give him another...
- Thanks.

33
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:41,842
I think it's really developing
very, very well,

34
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:45,545
particularly the end.
What I'd like to get into more quickly

35
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:48,986
- is the threat of the violence.
- Okay, well, let me do this.

36
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:50,990
Let me take out
Gino's balls

37
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:53,458
in a plastic bag.

38
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:55,654
Take it out of my pocket,
hold up his balls.

39
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:57,663
The balls will never read.
They're not gonna read as well.

40
00:01:57,697 --> 00:01:59,187
Balls will read.
Why won't balls read?

41
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:01,132
You got them
in plastic?

42
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:04,194
They'll be in a plastic bag
with some formaldehyde or something?

43
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:05,363
But it's a little
graphic for this.

44
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:07,805
I'd rather... that's
a big thing to do.

45
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:10,435
What's the matter with you?
Do you know what you're doing?

46
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:12,240
Do you really know
what you're doing?

47
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:14,179
This is just the threat
of the violence, okay?

48
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:16,842
What I'm concerned about, if this guy
says something, you should slap him.

49
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:18,976
- Like what?
- "Don't talk to me until I finish."

50
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:20,953
- Like that?
- Yeah, that kind of thing.

51
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:22,852
That's too hard.

52
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:24,789
- How many takes are we gonna do?
- Two more.

53
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:26,622
- Two more?
- Two more.

54
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,992
- You shoot too much, Marty.
- No, it's getting better each time.

55
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:32,157
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Two more takes... one after the other.

56
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,724
Same slate. We get the energy better
on the second take that way.

57
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:37,168
You know, "Seinfeld,"
we did two takes and we were done.

58
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:39,069
We're just getting into it.
It's rich.

59
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,333
It's getting better
and better every time you do it.

60
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:42,807
All right, try to watch
this one, okay?

61
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:45,277
I was gonna watch, but I couldn't get
away from the earphones.

62
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:48,042
- Then cut it or something.
- No, you were really good.

63
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:49,912
I'm not gonna
break it up.

64
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,180
All right.

65
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:55,416
- What did he say?
- Listen...

66
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:57,980
No, what was he saying?
What was Martin Scorsese saying to you?

67
00:02:58,024 --> 00:03:00,925
I don't know.
He has this little way of talking to me

68
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:03,156
- where it's subtle but...
- He doesn't like it?

69
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:07,292
I don't know, it's hard to tell.
Did my father call?

70
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,359
Oh, no, he hasn't
called yet.

71
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:11,563
But it's still
early in LA.

72
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:16,235
I don't know why he hasn't
called me back, you know?

73
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:20,305
My mother's sick.
He should call me back. I don't get it.

74
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:23,578
I know, I know.
It's hard to take anything you say

75
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:27,018
seriously right now.
You just look crazy.

76
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:29,613
I don't know if we're going to make
this plane. I really don't know.

77
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:32,591
He does
too many takes.

78
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,856
All right, Marty,
what's going on? We ready?

79
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:37,193
- Let's go. Joe?
- Get ready please, here we go.

80
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,822
Come on.

81
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:44,002
It's kind of nice
to be home, isn't it?

82
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:46,665
We should've made a right...
we should've made...

83
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:48,901
Honey, it's okay.

84
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:54,380
- I don't know what he's doing.
- It's fine.

85
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:58,043
I think I want to stop by my father's
on the way back.

86
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:01,713
I'll have the cab stop
and... drop me off.

87
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:03,723
You can
take it back home.

88
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:06,658
Okay, just
to check in?

89
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:10,561
Yeah, it's weird
that he hasn't called me back.

90
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:12,224
I don't know
what's going on.

91
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:13,459
Okay.

92
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,468
Listen, we're gonna
make a stop first.

93
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:17,493
I'm gonna
get dropped off.

94
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:22,770
Okay, that's good.
Very good. All right, honey.

95
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:27,235
- Hey, Dad.
- How are you, boychick?

96
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,111
- Good. How you doing?
- All right, doing fine, yeah.

97
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:31,549
- How'd you get here?
- I had the cab drop me off

98
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:34,520
from the airport
and Cheryl took it home.

99
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:36,488
Hey, I could've
picked you up.

100
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:38,548
Look at this place.
Very nice.

101
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:40,560
Looks like you've been living
here for a while.

102
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:43,529
- Well, listen, you look good here.
- How you doing, okay?

103
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:47,055
- Yeah.
- I called, you never got back to me.

104
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,159
I was busy,
you know, I got busy.

105
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:51,762
What do you mean, you "got busy"?
What are you doing?

106
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:53,898
Let me make you
a cup of coffee, huh?

107
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,407
Aw, I don't
want any coffee.

108
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:57,410
I just came to check up on you.
How's Mom doing?

109
00:04:57,444 --> 00:05:00,311
Oh, well, you know
how people do.

110
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:02,577
So... tell me
about New York!

111
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:04,208
Did you have
a good time in New York?

112
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,410
Um...

113
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:07,215
I mean, busy...?

114
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:10,416
You seem very jumpy.
What's the matter with you?

115
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:13,051
Well, I didn't expect you
to come in today.

116
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:14,424
I really didn't know
you were here.

117
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:15,894
Where's Mom?

118
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:17,794
Well... your mother.

119
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:19,423
Well, I'll tell you
all about your mother, you know...

120
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:23,163
after all, we brought her back.
Your mother, she got sicker

121
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:24,636
and we had to bring her
back to the hospital.

122
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:27,139
- She's in the hospital?
- Yeah, well, not now.

123
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:29,767
But we had to bring her
back for a while.

124
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:33,575
Why didn't you tell me?
You didn't even call.

125
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,945
She didn't want to bother you.
You know how she is.

126
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:39,611
She said,
"Don't bother him.

127
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:42,850
He's in New York.
Let him enjoy himself."

128
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,186
She didn't want
to spoil your trip.

129
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:47,022
She's not in the hospital now,
so that's over with.

130
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,028
- Don't worry about that.
- She's feeling better?

131
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:51,223
Well, in a way.
She did warn me.

132
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:56,099
She said, "If anything
happens to me, don't bother Larry.

133
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:58,263
He's in New York
and he wants to enjoy."

134
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:01,000
So then,
after a day or two...

135
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,703
nobody goes on forever
and ever and ever.

136
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:06,507
You're not gonna go on,
I'm not gonna go on...

137
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:09,140
- Is she dead?
- Er, yeah.

138
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:12,174
Dead, dead,
she's dead.

139
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:16,922
And she didn't want me
to bother you.

140
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:18,856
- What does that mean?
- Well, you were in New York.

141
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:22,350
You were having a good time,
so we didn't call.

142
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,522
W-when did she die?

143
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:26,429
Let's see, the funeral
was on Monday...

144
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,331
- The what?
- so she had to die on...

145
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:30,563
- Funeral?
- Yeah, funeral.

146
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:32,901
W-why wasn't...
I'm not at the funeral?

147
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:34,634
What do you mean
Monday was the funeral?

148
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:36,005
Well, Monday
was the funeral.

149
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,340
Why wasn't I at the funeral?
Why didn't you call me?

150
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:40,608
She told me not
to bother you...

151
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:43,775
She told you not to bother me?
What is that supposed to mean?

152
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,808
You were in New York.
You were busy.

153
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:47,820
So what? What do you mean, I was busy?
You give me a call!

154
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:52,917
You didn't call me? You didn't call me
to tell me my mother died?

155
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,688
The last words she said to me,
"If anything happens to me,

156
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:57,356
you don't bother Larry.
Don't spoil his trip in New York."

157
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:59,092
That's insane!

158
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:00,929
The woman did not
want to bother you.

159
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,663
I missed her funeral because
she told you not to call me?

160
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:06,228
- Is that what you're telling me?!
- That's right!

161
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,403
Who's that, Larry?

162
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:11,672
My condolences.

163
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:14,612
- Your cousin.
- I'm sorry.

164
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,842
- How are you?
- Hi, Andy.

165
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:19,181
I'm sorry, I really am.
Heard you were in New York.

166
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:22,120
You missed a good one.
This was really a nice...

167
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:25,022
I'm sorry I missed it. Had I been
informed,

168
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:29,119
I may have been able
to attend my mother's funeral.

169
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:30,754
- It was beautiful.
- Very nice.

170
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:33,891
Very well attended,
rabbi spoke beautifully...

171
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:37,596
honestly, rabbi spoke beautifully.
Like a friend.

172
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:41,266
I noticed you called
Andy in New York, and he flew in.

173
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:43,537
Your mother didn't say
not to call Andy.

174
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:47,842
She said not to call you,
that's all she ever said.

175
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:49,712
Why didn't you call me
when you were there?

176
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,842
It would have been nice
if you called.

177
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:54,615
You know, I was busy, Andy.
I couldn't see you.

178
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:57,214
I'm not talking
about that, just call me.

179
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,919
I figure if you're in town
just call and say hello.

180
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,483
I didn't need to see you.
I didn't need to visit.

181
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,689
What's the difference?
I could call when I'm in LA.

182
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,494
- I don't see the logic to it.
- You know what I'm talking about.

183
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:08,364
Don't be a putz.
What are you talking about?

184
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:11,165
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Are you arguing?

185
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,263
Are you out of your mind?
If you go to Florida,

186
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:14,796
you're not gonna call Aunt Cher?

187
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:17,503
Not necessarily.

188
00:08:17,544 --> 00:08:19,307
You come to town,
you give me a call.

189
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:21,609
If I can't see you,
there's no point in calling!

190
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:25,175
I didn't want to see you.
What is the matter with you?

191
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:27,186
Two people
related to each other,

192
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,848
two people, two cousins,
and you're arguing this way?

193
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,857
Okay, forget... I'm sorry I didn't
call you in New York.

194
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:34,689
I'm sorry you didn't either. It would
have been nice to hear your voice.

195
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:36,354
Let me show you
who was at this funeral.

196
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:38,694
Everybody was there,
my goodness.

197
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:41,222
Your Uncle Harold
was there.

198
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:44,031
He told his famous joke
that he always tells.

199
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,095
Yeah, about the temple,
I know, I know.

200
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,269
Abe Lincoln, he's Jewish.
He got "shot in the temple."

201
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,870
The food the first night
was not so good. It was just deli.

202
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:54,311
But I'll tell you,
people brought over...

203
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:56,577
we still got stuff in the fridge,
it's delicious.

204
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,106
Yeah, we have a lot
of hard-boiled eggs.

205
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:00,449
And the eulogy
was nice?

206
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:02,545
- It was beautiful.
- Take a look at how wonderful.

207
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,784
A lot of people
turned out.

208
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:08,590
"Beautiful service, sorry about
your loss. Where's Larry?"

209
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:19,132
The Sessons called
to send their condolences.

210
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:21,140
Who else called?

211
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:23,404
- We don't have to...
- No, who called?

212
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:28,437
Michael Adler called.
He wants to have lunch with you...

213
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:32,374
I haven't spoken with this guy
in five years.

214
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:34,010
What does he want to have lunch
with me for?

215
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:36,578
I don't know.

216
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:39,558
Caruso's called.
Your suit is ready,

217
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:42,117
which is actually good.

218
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:45,255
You're gonna need it
for Julie Blum's bat mitzvah.

219
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:48,199
And the Mandels are...

220
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,702
That bat mitzvah,
oh, God.

221
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:53,729
Is there anything worse?
Can you think of anything worse?

222
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,768
Go ahead, what else?

223
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,678
And the Mandels
want to confirm dinner on Saturday.

224
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:04,148
Okay.

225
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,947
No, that's not happening.
Cancel it.

226
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:11,784
- No dinner with...
- No, can't do that.

227
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:14,725
- What do you want me to tell them?
- Tell them whatever you want.

228
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:16,786
Okay.

229
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:21,765
Ahem... hi.

230
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:24,599
Mary, hi,
it's Cheryl David.

231
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:28,198
We're not gonna be able
to do dinner on Saturday.

232
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:33,040
Well, I'm sorry
to say, but...

233
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,376
Larry's mother
just passed away.

234
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:38,475
And we're going
to take some time with that.

235
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:43,251
Okay, thank you.
Okay, bye bye.

236
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:45,814
What did she say?

237
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:48,190
She said she's very sorry
to hear about your mother.

238
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:49,819
Really?

239
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:51,887
Yeah, and she
completely understood.

240
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:53,922
Huh.

241
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:57,766
Michael?
Larry David.

242
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,898
Pretty good.

243
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:05,275
I'd love to,
but you know what?

244
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:07,973
My mom died.

245
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:09,572
Yeah.

246
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:13,745
So I'm just not gonna
be doing much for a while.

247
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:16,050
Okay, yeah,
absolutely.

248
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:18,649
As soon as I get it together...

249
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,683
Hi.
It's Larry David.

250
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:23,821
Hey, I'll bet Julie's
pretty excited

251
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:25,888
about that
bat mitzvah, huh?

252
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:27,923
Unfortunately,

253
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,992
we're not gonna be
able to make it.

254
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:34,430
Well...
my mother died.

255
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:38,069
Tell Julie good luck,
sorry I can't be there.

256
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,341
And mazeltov.

257
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,507
You too, darling.

258
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:49,453
Larry, how did you
ever land this role in this film?

259
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:51,423
It's like
unbelievable to me.

260
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:53,721
I'm happy
for you,

261
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,129
- but how did that happen?
- He saw me at the...

262
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:00,257
at the lmprov

263
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,733
screaming at the audience
one night in New York.

264
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,498
- You mean ages ago?
- Yeah, ages ago.

265
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:06,334
He remembered this?

266
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,237
He remembered because
I was having it out

267
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:10,504
with this guy in the audience,
and he thought

268
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,034
I could play this tough Jew.
I don't know, it was weird.

269
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,411
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

270
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:17,279
That's fucking
unbelievable.

271
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:19,250
Maybe I should hang out
by his house and scream and yell.

272
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:22,015
No, that's great.
Speaking of screaming and yelling,

273
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,353
I'm trying to calm down
a little bit,

274
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,052
so I decided...
don't mock.

275
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:29,653
I'm gonna start...
I've never done it before, to meditate.

276
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:32,129
You know, I used to do it.
Did you know that?

277
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:35,225
- I vaguely remember.
- Yeah, I used to do it.

278
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:36,701
What do you do,
actually?

279
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:38,499
I had a mantra,
you know,

280
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:42,338
and you repeat this mantra
in your head.

281
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,899
- You repeat it?
- Yeah, say it over and over again.

282
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:47,174
- Where do you get mantras?
- From a yoga instructor.

283
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:49,408
I'm not gonna...
I have to sign up

284
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:51,644
for a yoga class
or a mantra class?

285
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:54,812
You could say anything you want.
Give yourself your own mantra.

286
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:56,822
You want a mantra?
I'll give you a mantra.

287
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:59,120
"Lonely, lonely..."

288
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,594
- "Lonely..."
- "Lonely..."

289
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:05,654
- Just keep repeating it.
- That would work?

290
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:08,496
You want mine?
I'll give you mine.

291
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:11,002
- Is that allowed?
- Who's gonna stop us?

292
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:14,840
- Nobody.
- It's totally applicable.

293
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:17,274
What is your mantra?

294
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,778
Okay.
Actually...

295
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:22,280
- Are you taking it back?
- No, I'm telling you.

296
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:24,681
- Oh.
- Ji...

297
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:26,275
- That's it?
- Ji ya.

298
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:27,877
Ji ya?
What does it mean?

299
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,388
I have no idea. But keep repeating it
over and over again...

300
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:33,881
"Ji ya, ji ya, ji ya"...
you know, half an hour,

301
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,188
20 minutes,
half an hour...

302
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:37,822
- "Ji..." oh, shit.
- What?

303
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:40,298
This guy, Ed Swindell.
He's spotted me.

304
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,459
He's gonna want
to do a "stop-and-chat."

305
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:43,662
Don't... don't,
don't go, don't go.

306
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:46,536
- Oh my God, I got to...
- Oh, what a fuck.

307
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:48,972
I got a lot of shopping
to do. Have a blast.

308
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:51,033
- Hey, Larry.
- Hey, Ed.

309
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:53,477
Good to see you.
What a surprise.

310
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:55,481
Good place,
isn't it?

311
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:57,983
Yeah, we're clothes shopping
and I had to get out of there.

312
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:00,611
You know, little Deslys,
"the princess,"

313
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:02,746
she's holding up
these two things.

314
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:04,813
"Which makes me look
more growed-up, Daddy?"

315
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:09,057
You know...

316
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:11,791
my mother...
just died.

317
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,857
Oh, Larry,
I'm so sorry.

318
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:18,302
I kind of need to be alone
with my own thoughts.

319
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:20,669
Oh, absolutely.
Jeez, bless your heart.

320
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:22,867
Our thoughts
are with you.

321
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:25,537
- Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah.

322
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:44,219
Excuse me.

323
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:46,630
Yep?

324
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,635
I'm looking for my mother's grave,
Adele David.

325
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:51,694
She was just buried.

326
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:53,398
Yeah, yeah.

327
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,532
I think it's supposed to be
right over there.

328
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,839
She got moved.
Special section.

329
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:00,778
What "special
section"?

330
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,804
You'd better talk
to the general manager.

331
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:06,181
Take a right here and it's the first
building on the right.

332
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:15,758
My mother was moved
to a special section?

333
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:18,423
Yes, evidently
you were out of town.

334
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:22,059
Well, I would've been here,
but I wasn't informed about it.

335
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:25,400
Well, obviously. We have a section
reserved for people

336
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:28,134
who... well, who just
don't qualify

337
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:30,165
for the interment
in consecrated ground.

338
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:35,704
It's a place where
we put the villains, the suicides,

339
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:38,945
the gentiles who are
from mixed marriages...

340
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:43,422
Okay, okay.
This is a horrendous mistake, okay?

341
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:45,947
Let me explain, please.
When the shammas examined her,

342
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:49,291
he found that she
had a tattoo

343
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:51,558
on the...

344
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:54,122
Tattoo?
My mother had a tattoo?

345
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,192
Yes, sir.
It's on the right cheek

346
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,227
of her right buttock
if you will.

347
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:03,534
My mother had
a tattoo on her ass?

348
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:07,239
On her right buttock,
yes, sir. Now...

349
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,147
So what if she did
have a tattoo, so what?

350
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:13,015
According to Leviticus,
"You shall not make any gashes

351
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:15,885
in your flesh for the dead,
nor incise yourself."

352
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:19,118
In other words,
to adorn oneself in such a manner,

353
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:22,252
was found by Maimonides...
many, many, years ago, of course...

354
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,661
to be an offense

355
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:27,791
which would disqualify
such a person

356
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,767
from burial
in consecrated ground.

357
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:31,997
Okay.

358
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:35,665
Look, I wasn't here.
I should've been here.

359
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,541
I wasn't called. My father
for some reason didn't call me.

360
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:40,704
- Your dad was here.
- If I was here,

361
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:43,442
this never would've happened.
Sir, I'm here now

362
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:47,077
and I'd like to rectify this.
I'd like to get her

363
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:49,747
where she's supposed to be,
where we paid for her plot.

364
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:52,519
Now, if there was some
youthful indiscretion,

365
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:54,719
and she got this tattoo...
which I still can't even

366
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,160
hardly believe my ears
when you even tell me this...

367
00:16:57,196 --> 00:17:00,791
but okay, say she does
have this tattoo over there.

368
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,030
You know...
so come on.

369
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,061
So what?

370
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:08,573
There's nothing
I can do, sir.

371
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,700
The law is the law.

372
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:19,010
That's two things
you didn't tell me.

373
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:22,487
All right, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, what can I do?

374
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,682
What are we gonna do about this
"special section" thing?

375
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:28,285
- We can't keep her there.
- This is ridiculous.

376
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:30,761
Well, that's true,
I don't understand this.

377
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:32,593
But they have
this special section.

378
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:34,861
It's the stupidest,
stupidest thing I ever heard of.

379
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,164
- I agree with you totally.
- Never heard of anything so insane.

380
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:39,194
I have heard of it.

381
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:41,934
She would be sick to her stomach
if she knew.

382
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:43,566
Yes, she would
be upset.

383
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:46,134
Bottom line is, she'd be sick
to her stomach.

384
00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:48,442
When did she
get this tattoo?

385
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:50,540
The tattoo?
We were just married.

386
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,710
We walked down
the boardwalk over there.

387
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:55,016
She saw a tattoo parlor.
She said, "Hey, let's do it."

388
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:57,454
Your parents
had tattoos.

389
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,548
With our names.

390
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:00,559
That was an epic...
words of love.

391
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:03,289
A real
show of love.

392
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:06,264
I can't imagine
my parents making love.

393
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:08,892
I can't imagine
you making love.

394
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:13,268
Wow! Well,
that looks good.

395
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,569
- Well, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

396
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:17,098
- Thank you, honey.
- So what's for dinner?

397
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:18,701
Turkey.

398
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:20,405
No, I had turkey
for lunch.

399
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:23,938
Oh, well...

400
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:26,451
It's all right,
it's okay.

401
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:29,352
I'm gonna go check
on that turkey.

402
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:32,186
- I'll take whatever you have.
- Thank you, Ned.

403
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:36,956
Bad call, huh?
Having turkey for lunch?

404
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,964
Well, who knew?
I didn't know.

405
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:40,966
You doubled up.

406
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,195
What am I gonna do,
order Chinese food in LA.?

407
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:47,072
You can't order
Chinese food in LA.?

408
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:48,801
There's no good
Chinese food in LA.

409
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:51,309
Right, 'cause all the good Chinese
cooks went to New York.

410
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:53,140
A country of
one billion people

411
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:56,239
couldn't send one good chef
to Los Angeles.

412
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:58,011
How can you
possibly be arguing

413
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,383
the quality of good Chinese food
in LA. versus New York?

414
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,445
All right, fine.

415
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:07,786
You know what?
come here, come here.

416
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:16,795
All right,
here's my idea, okay?

417
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:20,363
I want to get...
I want to move her body.

418
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:23,807
I want to move
the body to where it's supposed to be,

419
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:26,812
because Mom would not
want to be there.

420
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:29,371
It's not right.
I feel terrible about it.

421
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:30,780
And...

422
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:32,579
How do you move...
how do we move her?

423
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:34,848
I'm gonna try and pay off
the gravedigger is what I'm gonna do.

424
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:36,684
Wow.

425
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:39,122
That does not sound
like a good idea.

426
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:40,921
I think it sounds
fantastic.

427
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,952
It's not dangerous
because I don't have to do anything

428
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:46,362
but pay off the gravedigger,
that's all I have to do.

429
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:48,730
I think I can do it.
If he takes the money, fine,

430
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,325
if not, well,
at least I tried.

431
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:52,428
You think you can get
this man to dig it up?

432
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:55,599
If you offer somebody
enough money, they'll do it.

433
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:57,609
I got to tell you,
we tried everything we could.

434
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:59,235
We talked to these people.
They would have none of it.

435
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:02,008
If you can pay this guy off,
I say go do it.

436
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:05,915
I'd like to contribute.
I'd like to contribute a few dollars.

437
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:09,011
You're not contributing.
This whole tattoo thing is just...

438
00:20:09,054 --> 00:20:11,022
I agree with you
completely.

439
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:14,287
- Honest to God, I think it's a great...
- I think it's terrible.

440
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,658
- Shh... quiet, quiet.
- All right.

441
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:18,890
- We'll do it.
- I think it's a great idea.

442
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:21,297
- It's a great idea.
- It's a scary idea.

443
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:26,469
"Ji ya, ji ya, ji ya..."

444
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:39,643
Yeah, who is it?

445
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:42,483
- It's me.
- LD?

446
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:45,456
- Yeah.
- I can't, er...

447
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:47,925
What's the matter,
huh?

448
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,588
I'm meditating.

449
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:52,961
Oh, my God.
You're kidding.

450
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:55,159
No, I'm getting into this
and it's starting to work.

451
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,862
I just forgot to turn the phone off.
I'm just pissed off.

452
00:20:57,903 --> 00:21:00,497
Oh, I'm sorry. Actually, that's kind
of what I'm calling about.

453
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,406
- About what?
- I was calling about the mantra.

454
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:07,936
What about the mantra?
It's good, by the way. It's working.

455
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,677
I'm calling to see... maybe
I could get it back.

456
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:16,086
Get it back?
What is that? You gave it to me?

457
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:18,817
I changed my mind.
I'd like to get it back.

458
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:21,325
You can't be
an East Indian-giver.

459
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,420
Well, I had it first,
kind of, you know.

460
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:25,953
You did, but
you let me have it.

461
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:28,296
Now it's part
of my whole being.

462
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:31,462
My essence screams
of this mantra.

463
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:33,733
And it's been working,
and l...

464
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:36,570
- Really Larry, it's not fair.
- What about splitting it with me?

465
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:40,306
Splitting it? What is this,
a timeshare in the Hamptons?

466
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:43,179
- You don't split a mantra.
- Who says you can't split a mantra?

467
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:46,582
- Why can't you?
- It strikes me as being a tad...

468
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:48,143
homosexual.

469
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:51,452
- Get out. It's not a gay thing.
- I mean, we're not homosexual.

470
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,391
You don't have to tell me.
I know I'm not a homosexual.

471
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:57,020
I know, but I'm really having
a difficult time giving it back.

472
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:59,053
I mean, you did a nice turn
and you know,

473
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:00,827
and now you're reneging,
you know?

474
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:03,699
It's just that, you know,
my mother just died.

475
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:07,535
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:09,768
- All right, fine.
- Yeah?

477
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:12,208
- Yeah, yeah. yeah.
- Oh, fabulous.

478
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:13,905
Don't even think twice
about it, all right?

479
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:16,881
- Great, so we'll split it.
- Yeah okay, no problem.

480
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:18,940
- Fantastic.
- All right, man. Bye.

481
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:21,282
Who's that?

482
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,788
- Lewis.
- Lewis, how's Lewis?

483
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:26,814
- He's good.
- Yeah?

484
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:31,592
- I am exhausted.
- Oh, okay.

485
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:34,223
Good night, honey.

486
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:38,032
Good night?
Really, good night?

487
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,197
Good night.

488
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:45,433
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

489
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:49,379
No, no, please.
Honey, I just showered.

490
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:51,110
What? So what?
that's good for me.

491
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,744
I don't feel like getting
into all that right now.

492
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:55,720
- What? Why not?
- I'm very tired.

493
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:57,722
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

494
00:22:57,756 --> 00:23:00,418
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

495
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:06,988
You know, it was just that I've been
going through a rough time,

496
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:10,263
what with my mother
and all.

497
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:12,327
Oh...

498
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:15,738
I didn't even have a chance
to say good-bye.

499
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:18,607
Oh, honey.

500
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:27,782
Hey!

501
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,879
How you doing?

502
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:32,755
Remember me?

503
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:47,896
All right.

504
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,374
Meet me
at the grave.

505
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:52,809
8:00 tonight.

506
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:56,745
You better bring
some friends to help.

507
00:23:56,782 --> 00:24:00,115
- Help what?
- Dig.

508
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:05,521
All these stones
look alike.

509
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:07,525
Completely,
completely lost.

510
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,720
Watch your feet.

511
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:11,821
You step on
one of these things, you'll trip...

512
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:13,991
- Hey, over here.
- Hey.

513
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:16,796
Hey!
Hey!

514
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:21,433
You're late.

515
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:23,907
Yeah, well,
we got kind of lost.

516
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:26,740
Welcome to
the special section.

517
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:28,940
- Oh my God.
- Here you go, gentlemen.

518
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:33,344
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your work.

519
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:35,853
Thank you.

520
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:37,617
Hey, what about you?

521
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:40,921
I only got
four shovels.

522
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:43,553
Asshole.

523
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:46,894
All right.

524
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:32,405
Ji ya.

525
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:34,036
Ji ya.

526
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,709
Ji ya, ji ya, ji ya...

527
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,743
Ji ya, ji ya, ji ya,
I made it out of clay

528
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:45,586
And when it's dry and ready,
oh, ji ya I will play

529
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:48,058
Yo! Ji ya, ji ya,
ji ya, ya ji ya ji-ji-ji...

530
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,427
- Who is it?
- Your friend, Richard Lewis.

531
00:25:57,469 --> 00:26:00,131
Oh, Richie boy!

532
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:03,673
- Larry...
- Oh, a little pop-in, huh?

533
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:06,007
- Yeah, a bit of a pop-in.
- No call?

534
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:08,808
No. Happy?

535
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:13,351
I don't know what
you're talking about.

536
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:17,082
The mantra that
you so nicely lent to me,

537
00:26:17,122 --> 00:26:20,285
that I said
maybe 400,000 times...

538
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:22,122
"Ji ya"?
What, what?

539
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,027
I found out what it meant from some
chick who does this meditation stuff.

540
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:27,327
- What does it mean?
- Well, you can take "ji ya,"

541
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:29,891
and take that mantra
and shove it up your ass.

542
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:32,495
- You know what it means?
- No, what does it mean?

543
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:34,630
"Fuck me."

544
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:38,074
Fuck me!

545
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,840
Fuck you!

546
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,881
Hmm.

547
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:54,589
Beautiful day,
isn't it?

548
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:56,856
Yes, it is.

549
00:26:56,895 --> 00:27:00,160
- You hear the birds?
- Um-hm.

550
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,600
Sometimes I like
to pretend that I'm deaf

551
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:08,800
and I try to imagine
what it would be like...

552
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,503
- Right.
...not to be able to hear them.

553
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:14,637
It's not so bad.

554
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:26,149
You expecting
somebody?

555
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:28,716
- No.
- Huh.

556
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:33,855
Hi.

557
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:35,696
Can we come in
and talk to you please?

558
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:38,999
- Oh, sure.
- You don't mind? Thank you.

559
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:41,369
We're looking for a Larry David,
ma'am. Can you help us?

560
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:45,342
- Oh, why?
- Is he here, ma'am?

561
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:47,971
Well, I'm wondering
what this is about.

562
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:49,480
We need to speak
with him, ma'am.

563
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:51,778
Hey, that's him,
that's the guy.

564
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:56,448
Mr. David? We're gonna need you
to come with us, sir.

565
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:58,547
What are you
talking about?

566
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,024
Evidently you've been passing
some bad bills around town, sir.

567
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,220
- Can you help us out with that? - 
Counterfeit bills, sir.

568
00:28:03,261 --> 00:28:05,126
Yeah, that's right.

569
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,268
Counterfeit bills.
Put your hands down, sir.

570
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:14,397
Oh... okay, all right.
I know what happened here.

571
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:17,602
I was in this movie, and they gave me
this counterfeit money.

572
00:28:17,642 --> 00:28:20,167
- I understand.
- And... no, I'll...

573
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:21,839
- Relax your arms, sir.
- You can't be serious.

574
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,007
- Stay calm.
- I'll give you real money.

575
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:25,812
No, but I'll give you
real money.

576
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:29,719
- My mother died...
- I'm very sorry.

577
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:32,724
Ji ya!

578
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,726
Ji ya!
