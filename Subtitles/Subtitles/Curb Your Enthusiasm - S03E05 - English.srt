1
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:16,089
Four for David.

2
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,724
Let me see... no,
I'm not finding that.

3
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:23,532
Try Braudy.
B-R-A-U-D-Y.

4
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,130
Here we go, for four.
All right.

5
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:28,403
They haven't arrived.
Would you like to be seated?

6
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:31,240
- Sure.
- Right this way.

7
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,736
I'm looking. They automate it right.
I'll tell you that.

8
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:37,045
- Hey.
- Hey, look who's here.

9
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:39,814
- Guys, how are you?
- Good to see you.

10
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:42,822
What are you doing here?
Well, let me guess.

11
00:00:42,856 --> 00:00:44,949
We're gonna
take a nap, yeah.

12
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:48,392
We're gonna meet some friends
and have dinner.

13
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:51,420
Okay, I didn't mean to pry
into your life there.

14
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:54,127
I meant, what are you doing in general?
What's going on?

15
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,795
You know what?
I'm investing in a restaurant.

16
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:59,465
What are you touching?
No reason to touch.

17
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:01,371
- Did I overstep my boundary?
- No touching here.

18
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:03,876
- Do you need the money?
- I think it will be fun to do,

19
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,105
you know, showing
people to their table.

20
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:08,011
You'll be working there
like a busboy?

21
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:10,778
No... remember when we used
to hang out in comedy clubs in New York?

22
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:13,581
I didn't invest.
I just went there and I left.

23
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,747
I didn't lock up.

24
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:18,553
- Are you gonna lock up the restaurant?
- I'm not gonna lock up.

25
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,325
"See you there, Rocco."
I went with "Rocco."

26
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:25,058
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

27
00:01:25,098 --> 00:01:27,362
'Night, Paul,
see you later.

28
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,962
Larry, you are so rude.

29
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:35,133
Why?

30
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:37,200
You didn't say
one word to Mindy.

31
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:41,136
You didn't look in her direction
the whole time.

32
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:44,617
Did you say
anything to her?

33
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:48,214
You do that
all the time.

34
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:50,348
I said hello, didn't I?

35
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,153
I don't think
you did, honestly.

36
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:55,218
- I didn't say hello?
- No.

37
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:58,060
- No, I said hello.
- I don't think you did.

38
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:00,692
I think you were
very caught up in Paul.

39
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:03,601
You didn't even
look over at her.

40
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:06,037
Oh, she must think
I'm such an asshole.

41
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:07,903
Yeah.

42
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,205
Did you even
notice her?

43
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:13,838
Well, I smelled her perfume.
It's hard not to notice.

44
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,711
Well, she owns
a perfume shop.

45
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:20,652
The whole night is just...
you can't leave your house.

46
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:26,157
Bye, bye.

47
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:28,525
She didn't even wave
goodbye or anything.

48
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,723
By the way,
when the check comes tonight,

49
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:34,666
Stu can pick it up.
Don't pick up the check.

50
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:37,499
- Yeah, I paid the last two times...
- You have.

51
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:40,370
He runs to the bathroom
every time the check comes.

52
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:42,238
I've noticed
the bathroom trick.

53
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:44,470
- He's got that trick down.
- He really does.

54
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:46,536
Hi. I'm so late, late.

55
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,514
No, you're not late,
don't worry about it.

56
00:02:48,548 --> 00:02:50,675
Good to see you.

57
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:53,843
We would've been here
10 minutes earlier

58
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:56,856
if we'd valeted the car instead
of trying to find a parking space.

59
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,858
I'm not gonna
valet the car.

60
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:00,985
I got this new Cadillac CTS.

61
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:03,291
Drives like a dream.
I'm gonna give it to the valet?

62
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,298
Yeah, it's our third child.

63
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:07,994
Did you happen to run
into the Reisers outside?

64
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:10,832
We saw them,
but no eye contact.

65
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:13,032
No, they didn't see us.

66
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:17,169
They're not invited
to the NRDC benefit at your house?

67
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,178
I don't think it would
be a good idea, do you?

68
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:21,544
It just felt like it would
be hypocritical.

69
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:25,312
It is so generous of you guys to open
your house to this benefit.

70
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:27,718
- And your hearts.
- It's a big undertaking.

71
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:29,779
It is a big undertaking.
But you know what?

72
00:03:29,823 --> 00:03:33,224
I get to have Alanis Morissette
singing in my living room.

73
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,421
- I cannot wait.
- She's fantastic.

74
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:37,362
That first album... the song
"You Oughta Know"...

75
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:39,865
And she's referring
to this "Mr. Duplicity"...

76
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,095
Larry has no idea
what we're talking about.

77
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:45,901
When you said "Mr. Duplicity,"
I thought you were referring to me...

78
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,567
You know who it's about?
Her guitar player.

79
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,701
No, it's a big secret.
She's never said.

80
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:52,712
She has never...
she's never said.

81
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:56,011
It was an actor in a sitcom
about a family.

82
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,212
Yeah, or I think I've heard her
manager. But it's this huge secret.

83
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:01,220
She'll tell me.
People confide in me.

84
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,950
- She'll open up to you, Larry.
- Everybody opens up to me.

85
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,550
I'll find out.
I'm gonna find out the big secret.

86
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:09,255
- Okay, good.
- Your parents are out here?

87
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:12,231
Yeah, yeah,
they moved out.

88
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:14,529
- How's your mom?
- Ah, you know, so-so.

89
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:15,899
Yeah.

90
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:19,303
- Who could go for some wine?
- I could, yeah.

91
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,103
- Oh, that was good.
- That was great.

92
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:25,202
It's official.
I'm now full.

93
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,975
Now you are.
The Fat Boy's Special.

94
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:29,811
You're done?

95
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:31,510
I'll go to the little
fat boy's room.

96
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:34,281
I know, okay.
He knows.

97
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:37,154
- It's the Fat Boy's Special.
- Look what you've done.

98
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,522
He knows.

99
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,770
Well, it was good
to see you guys again.

100
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:57,265
It was great to see you.
I probably won't till...

101
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,938
- Probably the benefit.
- Yeah.

102
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,242
I said don't
pick up the check!

103
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,278
Well, last night was it,
believe me.

104
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,790
All right,
I'm going out.

105
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:13,622
All right.

106
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,287
What will I do
about Mindy Reiser?

107
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,091
I wish I could
make it up to her.

108
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,928
I could've at least asked
about the perfume store.

109
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:22,662
People love when you ask them
about what they're doing.

110
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:25,398
Next time you see her
just be nice to her.

111
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:28,601
She thinks I'm the world's
biggest schmuck.

112
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:31,543
Hey, Larry.
I got to talk to Cheryl.

113
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:33,808
Hey, Wanda,
what's going on?

114
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:35,815
I have some news.

115
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:38,181
Are you okay?

116
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,186
Yeah, and no.

117
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,245
But I got to tell you
something.

118
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:44,256
You might as well
get over here too.

119
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,088
Oh, my God,
you're so serious.

120
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:50,290
- It's big.
- What's going on?

121
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,231
Okay.
My brother...

122
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:55,257
his best friend
works for the CIA.

123
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:59,135
He got this information
from the highest source possible.

124
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:01,640
There is going to be
a terrorist attack

125
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:04,508
this weekend in LA.

126
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,944
Yeah, and you cannot
tell a soul.

127
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:13,179
My brother told me,
but I'm not supposed to tell anybody.

128
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:16,484
But you know, you my girl,
I had to tell you.

129
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:18,718
- Thank you.
- I'm getting out of town.

130
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:21,226
I'm going to Vegas
with my boyfriend.

131
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:24,321
- I advise y'all to do the same.
- What kind of attack?

132
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:26,662
Attack, Larry.
Anthrax, a bomb, I don't know.

133
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,531
It could be something crazy.

134
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:30,058
And this is...

135
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:33,334
They said it's 90% sure
that something's gonna go down.

136
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:36,274
- Why can't we tell anybody?
- They don't want panic, Cheryl.

137
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,334
That's why they're
not telling anybody.

138
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:40,437
We got to get out of here.

139
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,780
- Yeah, get out of here.
- This weekend there's a big...

140
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:48,447
NRDC benefit that we've been
working on for months.

141
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:50,718
Alanis Morissette
is gonna be there.

142
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:52,588
I'm just, I'm thinking out loud.

143
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,889
Why don't we call
the terrorists and ask them

144
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:57,692
could they pick another weekend
more suited for you?

145
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:00,393
Postpone the benefit,
let's get out of here.

146
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:03,095
I thought I'd never say this,
but Larry's right.

147
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:05,570
If we don't show up
at the benefit,

148
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:08,369
- what will people...
- lf? What?

149
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:12,844
Look, okay,
I did my part.

150
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,006
You're my friend,
I had to tell you.

151
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:17,016
- Thank you.
- I'm going to Vegas.

152
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,314
- Okay, okay.
- Y'all out your mind.

153
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:22,685
I'm trying to help people,
they're talking about a benefit.

154
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:25,054
Call me when you
get back into town.

155
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:27,924
Hopefully
you'll be here.

156
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:31,822
Wow.

157
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:34,925
Yeah, Larry.

158
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:38,028
I just don't see how
we can leave this weekend.

159
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:41,973
This whole NRDC
benefit was my idea.

160
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:44,476
I talked the Braudys
into having it at their house.

161
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:47,503
Alanis Morissette
is coming to sing.

162
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,640
I mean, I just...

163
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:53,514
I just know
I can't leave town.

164
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:58,319
Well, maybe...

165
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:02,993
you know,
maybe I can...

166
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,054
I can go.

167
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,692
And where are you
gonna go?

168
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:15,332
I could go golfing
at Pebble Beach, maybe?

169
00:08:17,477 --> 00:08:20,742
Mm-hmm. Do you think
that's a good idea?

170
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,207
For us to be apart
if something did happen?

171
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:30,154
Then at least, you know,
one of us would...

172
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,591
survive.

173
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:35,355
It just seems like
if we're gonna go,

174
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:38,831
- we should go together.
- Not necessarily.

175
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,133
Almost seems
a little... selfish

176
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:51,234
that you would want
both of us to...

177
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:55,211
perish.

178
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,242
So, you'd be fine
going on without me?

179
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:04,456
Well, it would be...

180
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,859
very difficult
at first, I'm sure.

181
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:12,262
But hopefully
I could at some point

182
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:16,166
get back some
semblance of a life.

183
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,003
Okay...

184
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,065
if you feel good
about...

185
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:27,011
one of us... dying

186
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,673
and the other one
surviving,

187
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:32,344
and you can live with that
for the rest of your life,

188
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:36,685
then you should
go golf this weekend.

189
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:41,921
- I'll think about it.
- Think about it.

190
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,219
Hey, Mindy.

191
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:09,881
Oh, Larry.
Paul's not here.

192
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:13,689
I came actually to see you.
Do you have a few minutes?

193
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:15,956
I need to talk to you,
it's pretty important.

194
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:18,088
- You came to see me?
- Yeah.

195
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:19,462
What for?

196
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:23,299
Okay, this is going
to sound a little crazy.

197
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:26,305
But believe me,
it's all true.

198
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,797
I have a friend
who has a friend

199
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:33,107
whose brother
works in the CIA.

200
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:37,981
And he has it from the highest
possible source

201
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:40,986
that there's going to be
a terrorist attack

202
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,286
on Los Angeles
this weekend.

203
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,122
- It sounds crazy.
- You're putting me on.

204
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,287
- I'm not putting you on.
- This is a joke.

205
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:52,594
- Larry, come on.
- This is not a joke, this is the truth.

206
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:54,623
- Paul put you up to this?
- No, he didn't.

207
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,692
I haven't even
spoken to him.

208
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:59,102
You have a contact
in the government?

209
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:02,801
- Totally reliable.
- Are you serious?

210
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:08,075
Mindy, your life is in danger.
Get out of here.

211
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:10,082
What kind of attack
is it gonna be?

212
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:12,141
- It wasn't very specific.
- Where?

213
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:14,585
It could be anywhere.
It's in LA.

214
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,987
Oh my God, I can't believe it.
Oh my God, all right.

215
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:19,321
Okay?

216
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,589
I have to call my sister.

217
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:24,027
No, no, no,
you can't tell anybody.

218
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:26,122
I have to call my mother.
She's 80 years old.

219
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:29,066
She can't survive
a terrorist attack.

220
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,263
You can't say
anything, Mindy.

221
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:34,171
Okay, she lives in Orange County.
She's kind of far away.

222
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:36,971
They're not going
to Orange County, the terrorists.

223
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,308
They have nothing
in Orange County.

224
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:41,313
So we've got to get
out of town, huh?

225
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:43,781
- Absolutely.
- Maybe we'll go to the desert.

226
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:45,875
Maybe that will be good?
Palm Springs?

227
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:49,877
Palm Springs, why not?
It's 90 minutes, very nice.

228
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:52,390
Where do you stay
when you're there?

229
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:53,949
- Four Seasons.
- Four Seasons?

230
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,961
Yeah.

231
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:58,657
Maybe we'll go there,
or up north.

232
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:01,166
Santa Barbara is lovely
this time of year.

233
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,633
Where are you
and Cheryl going?

234
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:06,229
Unfortunately,
we can't go.

235
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:08,240
You can't...

236
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:12,301
oh, the Braudys'
NRDC event.

237
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:15,974
- You know about that thing, huh?
- Of course I know about it.

238
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:18,711
Our invitation got "lost in the mail"
or something.

239
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:21,481
- I don't want to get in the middle...
- No, listen,

240
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:24,012
I know you and Cheryl don't have
anything to do with it.

241
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,820
It's between us
and the Braudys.

242
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,792
But it's amazing
you are staying in town

243
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:30,523
risking your lives
for something like this.

244
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:33,123
It's unbelievable.

245
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,498
Cheryl wanted to leave,

246
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:38,197
I thought it's best that
we go to the benefit.

247
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:42,401
It's amazing.
I have a million things to do,

248
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:44,740
but I'm curious
about something.

249
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:48,110
- Why did you tell me?
- What are you talking about?

250
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:51,173
You're friends,
we like you so much,

251
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:53,344
you and Paul, you know.
I was driving around,

252
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:56,981
I saw your shop, I thought,
"I've got to tell Mindy."

253
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:59,048
I have really
misjudged you.

254
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:02,425
I can't thank you enough.
You are an amazing person.

255
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:05,397
You are a wonderful
human being.

256
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:08,525
- I can't thank you enough.
- I'm trying to be a good friend.

257
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:11,332
I understand. Listen!
I have some samples.

258
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,134
I want you to take these.

259
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:17,700
Give them to Cheryl, okay?
With my love.

260
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:20,439
Here you go.
She'll like these.

261
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,850
- Nothing for men?
- Oh, yeah, here.

262
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:29,981
You'll like these.
This is aftershave.

263
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:32,149
- Uh-huh.
- This is before-shave.

264
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:38,920
Got you some
of these samples.

265
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,592
What?

266
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:45,366
These are moisturizers
from Mindy Reiser's shop.

267
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:48,532
Really? I wish I would've
known you were going.

268
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:52,101
She carries that perfume
Wanda wears that I love.

269
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:55,114
Would've had you pick me up a bottle.
Why did you go there?

270
00:13:55,148 --> 00:14:01,053
To kind of... apologize
for the other night.

271
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:04,545
Larry David...
apologize?

272
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,649
- That's very...
- Why, is that unusual?

273
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,990
It's unusual, yes,
highly unusual, yes.

274
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:11,189
I feel like I apologize
to somebody every day.

275
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,461
- Are you kidding me?
- Who says "I'm sorry" more than me?

276
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,162
Do you know anybody
in the world?

277
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:19,637
I'll get it. Hello.

278
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:23,164
- Hi, Paul. Yeah...
- Paul Reiser?

279
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,877
Hello?

280
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:27,903
Hey.

281
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:31,075
Yeah, pretty much.

282
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:37,421
Yeah, l... well...

283
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:39,583
I don't know. 90%.

284
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:45,660
Well, hey, come on.
Of course, no problem.

285
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:47,893
I'm happy to.

286
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:51,768
Yeah, okay.
Well, you take care.

287
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:54,398
- All right, bye.
- What was that about?

288
00:14:56,309 --> 00:15:00,439
Oh, you know,
I went to apologize to his wife.

289
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,414
Oh. And what was "90%"?

290
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:07,686
He asked me
what the chances were

291
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,918
that this could
happen again...

292
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,290
- that I'd ignore her.
- Right.

293
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:17,125
Listen, I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

294
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:19,927
I really think we should
reconsider going...

295
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:22,025
we should get out of here,
don't you think?

296
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:23,262
No.

297
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,395
This is crazy, to hang
around here. What for?

298
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:28,202
We are gonna
stay right here.

299
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:32,474
- Where are all the cars?
- I don't know.

300
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:36,572
Is there a valet
we missed or something?

301
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:41,615
- Hi.
- Hey, Stu.

302
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:44,680
Hi, Larry and Cheryl.

303
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:46,589
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

304
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:48,719
- Where's all the cars?
- Please come in.

305
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:51,252
The party's in full swing.
Come on.

306
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:58,166
Are we the first
ones here?

307
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:01,196
Where is everybody?

308
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,231
I'm actually surprised
you're here,

309
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:05,801
'cause, you know, there's
a terrorist attack

310
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:09,713
that is going to "take out
the entire city of Los Angeles."

311
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:12,013
Some time this weekend.

312
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:14,952
You'll notice Alanis Morissette
is not here.

313
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:16,978
- Obviously.
- She got very nervous,

314
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:18,854
- she said she wouldn't sing.
- She left town.

315
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,984
- Really?
- Gone. Yeah.

316
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:25,361
- 'Cause she heard...?
- Apparently the word kind of spread.

317
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:27,366
It sounds like
it might've started

318
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,425
with Mindy Reiser.

319
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:33,805
And guess
who told Mindy?

320
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,773
Who?

321
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:40,305
- Me?
- What?

322
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:44,282
- No...!
- You told Mindy Reiser about this?

323
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:46,251
Okay, so you knew?

324
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:47,912
This is exactly
what Wanda said!

325
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:50,717
She said don't cause a panic,
don't tell people.

326
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,656
Did we not have
this discussion?

327
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:56,890
- It's a little embarrassing...
- This is a little embarrassing.

328
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:00,330
This is humiliating
beyond belief is what this is.

329
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:03,267
I felt bad because I snubbed Mindy
at dinner the other night,

330
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:04,963
I didn't talk to her and l...

331
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:08,337
Told her there'd be a terrorist attack
in Los Angeles this weekend?

332
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,274
There was supposed to be one!

333
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,641
- You tell Mindy Reiser?
- She has betrayed us...

334
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:16,409
Time after time. She opens her mouth.
You can't tell that woman anything.

335
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,417
Why do you think
we don't talk to her?

336
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,783
- I don't know!
- She has a big mouth!

337
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,720
And by the way, Larry,

338
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:25,451
thank you for telling us
about this terrorist attack.

339
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:27,618
- I didn't tell anybody else.
- You told Mindy.

340
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,127
That's really nice of you.

341
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,322
Why don't you call
your friends, the Reisers?

342
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:33,457
Why don't you have
a little bite with them?

343
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,967
Since you snubbed them and all,
go ahead, all right?

344
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,969
I am going to bed.

345
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:41,131
Have a little bite
with the Reisers.

346
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:44,108
At least they pick up a check
every now and then.

347
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:46,668
- What the hell does that mean?
- What?

348
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:48,942
I know what you do every
time the check comes...

349
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:51,108
you run to the bathroom.

350
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,710
- Oh, fuck you.
- Honey, don't!

351
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:55,721
You don't think I know about
that bathroom trick?

352
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:58,815
- I invented that trick.
- Go to hell!

353
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:01,793
The "bathroom trick"?
I got a problem, a medical problem.

354
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:04,387
Yeah, you got a problem
paying money.

355
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:10,427
- No, thank you.
- I'll take one, thanks.

356
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:15,770
Mmm, very good.

357
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:20,770
- Who's the chef?
- I don't know.

358
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:25,348
- I shouldn't ask.
- I don't think you should.

359
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:27,852
Thank you... okay,
that's enough, come on.

360
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:30,321
I just want to know,
for the restaurant.

361
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:36,087
Were you not listening when Wanda
told you not to tell anybody?

362
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,426
She trusted you not to say
anything to anyone.

363
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:41,160
Why in the world would you
tell Mindy Reiser?

364
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,227
I was trying to get
on her good side.

365
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:58,543
I guess what we should do
is have it here.

366
00:18:58,584 --> 00:18:59,710
What?

367
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:01,845
Reschedule the benefit
and have it here.

368
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:04,082
Okay.

369
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:08,789
And I'll have to ask
the Braudys to come over.

370
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:11,888
The Braudys? No, no, no.
They're not coming, forget it.

371
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:13,865
They went way over
the line tonight.

372
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:16,424
Invite the Reisers,
not the Braudys.

373
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:18,630
Invite the Reisers
for spite.

374
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:21,139
This isn't a game, Larry.

375
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:23,539
Braudys "freaking."

376
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:26,044
Everything's "freaking" with this guy.
He can't say the word fuck?

377
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:29,377
I can understand why
they'd be upset, Larry.

378
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:32,384
Freaking asshole.

379
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:41,285
You don't gargle much,
do you?

380
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:45,263
It's fun.
You should think about it.

381
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:47,322
You should think
about how much money

382
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:49,459
you just lost for the NRDC.

383
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:53,971
N-E-S-T-L-E-S

384
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:59,569
Nestle's makes
the very best

385
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:02,479
Sorr-ry.

386
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:12,821
Hey, Larry, how come
you never told me?

387
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:15,486
I heard there was supposed
to be a terrorist attack

388
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:18,053
and you knew about it?
How come you never told me?

389
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:21,157
I wasn't allowed
to tell anyone.

390
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,997
You told somebody.

391
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:25,265
I mean, I found out.

392
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:27,101
So you could've
told me something.

393
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:30,768
I could... there were too many people,
I wasn't supposed to.

394
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:33,505
My kids could've been wiped out.
They go to school.

395
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:35,776
I'm sorry, but it's okay,
nothing happened.

396
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:37,839
I know, but something
could've happened.

397
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:39,783
We could've been
killed, you know?

398
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:42,582
- You could've given me a hint.
- Next time, I'll tell you.

399
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:44,589
Take your kids out of the school
or something like that.

400
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:46,318
I'll tell you next time,
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:49,452
You could've
said something.

402
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:51,520
Let me call you back.

403
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:56,224
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

404
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:57,997
Larry, I can't believe
that you knew

405
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:00,164
there was a terrorist threat
and didn't tell me.

406
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:01,934
Here we go
with this again.

407
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:04,067
- Me?
- I couldn't tell anyone.

408
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:07,010
I'm the person that's here
for you five days a week.

409
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:09,446
I've taken your laundry
and dry cleaning.

410
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:12,848
I didn't tell a lot of people.
I only told one person.

411
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:16,480
- You've told me secrets before.
- I'm sorry.

412
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:20,049
I'm sorry. Now I have to have
everybody mad at me,

413
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:21,992
'cause I didn't tell
everybody I know?

414
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:24,825
It's not my fault,
I told one person.

415
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:28,361
Wanda is here,
she's in the restroom.

416
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,925
She'll be out in a minute.
She'd like to speak with you.

417
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,700
Hey, big mouth!

418
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,975
What did I tell you, Larry?

419
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:42,773
Do you think this'll get me
out of the dog house?

420
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:44,646
- This is hard to find.
- Can I smell that?

421
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:48,779
Yeah, oh yeah.
That's the one Wanda got.

422
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:51,221
That's it, yeah.
I hope it does the trick.

423
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:54,282
Paul and I spent the whole
weekend in Palm Springs.

424
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:58,062
- It was really a disruption.
- Yeah.

425
00:21:58,097 --> 00:22:00,088
To pack up
and leave like that.

426
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:01,929
I'm sorry there wasn't an attack.

427
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:05,403
Well, Larry, I know that you had
the best of intentions.

428
00:22:05,437 --> 00:22:08,463
But my God, it was
a huge inconvenience for us.

429
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:11,032
I was just trying
to save your life.

430
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:13,738
Yes, I know.
We drove three hours to the desert

431
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:17,078
with the dog and the cats.
Four Seasons was booked.

432
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:19,744
We ended up staying
at a Super Eight motel.

433
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:22,777
- It was awful.
- I'm sorry I mentioned anything.

434
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:25,255
I tried to be a nice guy,
I'm trying to save your life,

435
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,588
and you have a terrible
weekend on my account.

436
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:28,991
Larry, no, I understand.

437
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:33,192
It would've been nice if there was a
small explosion, where nobody got hurt.

438
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:35,063
A little firecracker
or something.

439
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,558
What happened with you?
How did the NRDC thing go?

440
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:41,767
- Not too good.
- What happened?

441
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:44,833
- Nobody showed up.
- Why not?

442
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:48,438
Everybody heard about
the terrorist attack

443
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,971
and left town.

444
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:54,076
Oh my God.

445
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,451
'Cause I didn't say anything,
I was wondering

446
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:58,888
if perhaps you had mentioned
something to anyone.

447
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:02,325
Why would I say anything?
You told me not to.

448
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:06,987
- Oh, that's terrible...
- Hey, it's Martin Short.

449
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:09,830
- Larry?
- I know him.

450
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:12,769
Larry! Lar...

451
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:16,574
Marty!

452
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:20,738
Larry! Oh my God,
Larry, how are you?

453
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,872
- Good. How you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

454
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,940
Good. How's your show doing
on the Comedy Central?

455
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:26,746
You do that big fat guy...

456
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:28,412
- "Prime Time Glick."
- "Prime time Glick"?

457
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:31,355
How do you do that voice?
I try and do it at home.

458
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,882
It's ranges that go high
and then go very low.

459
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:36,986
"Ranges that go high
and then go very low."

460
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:40,988
But you're not going low...
high, very high.

461
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:42,295
Very high...

462
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:44,063
No, that sounds
like Miss Piggy.

463
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:46,128
It's not that at all.

464
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:48,731
It's much more...
not to pat myself on the back,

465
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:50,537
much more original.

466
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:52,009
Oh, my goodness,
Larry David.

467
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:53,534
"Oh, my goodness,
Larry David."

468
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:56,275
- How wonderful to see you.
- "How wonderful to see yoo-ou."

469
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:59,978
You have that kind of
flat New Yawk thing.

470
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,452
Well, let me try
one more time.

471
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:05,855
High, and then low.

472
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:07,654
And then be stunned
in the middle.

473
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:11,493
No, now you've had a stroke.

474
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,022
You don't want to play a stroke victim,
'cause that's... urrgh!

475
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:17,297
Oh, Jesus.
You know what?

476
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:20,794
I left her hanging in the store.
She's gonna be mad.

477
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,932
There are more impersonations
I'd love to teach you.

478
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:26,103
- Well, good to see you.
- Okay. Good to see you, Larry.

479
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:39,788
Pick it up...
just a little closer.

480
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:41,588
We may not even
need this actually.

481
00:24:41,627 --> 00:24:43,219
- I don't know about that.
- I don't know.

482
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:45,127
The acoustics are great
in this house.

483
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:46,631
And you would
know because...

484
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:48,860
We often have Friday night
services here.

485
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:51,734
Oh, my God,
this is so exciting.

486
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,739
I am so excited.

487
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:57,799
I'm acting like I'm not thrilled
to be sitting here with you,

488
00:24:57,843 --> 00:24:59,811
but I am just out
of my mind right now.

489
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:01,278
Me too, I've been
urinating all day.

490
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:04,544
Really? That's the effect
I often have on people.

491
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:07,952
You've got
to be kidding me?!

492
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:10,648
They invited
the Reisers and not us?

493
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:14,921
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
but I'm gonna do something.

494
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,694
Thank you.

495
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:25,532
Thanks for coming over.
I can't wait for tonight.

496
00:25:25,571 --> 00:25:27,129
Yeah, me too.
I'll see you guys.

497
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:29,572
Okay,
see you later.

498
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:31,007
All right.

499
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:33,739
Hey, you gonna do,
"You Oughta Know"?

500
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,441
We can.
You want that one?

501
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:39,780
Yeah.
That would be good.

502
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:41,877
We haven't done it in a while
so we can do it...

503
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,319
the unplugged
version.

504
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:46,586
A lot of discussion
about that song.

505
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,354
Yeah, nonstop
for a while.

506
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:50,258
It's dying down
a little bit, thank God.

507
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:53,128
You never tell
anybody, huh?

508
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:55,099
No. I purposely
don't tell anybody

509
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,101
because it's not what
the song is written for.

510
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:59,330
Sure, I understand.
Ever want to unburden yourself,

511
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:01,737
I just want you
to know...

512
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:04,207
I won't tell a soul
I won't even tell her.

513
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:05,767
- Really?
- Absolutely.

514
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:08,678
You guys don't have pillow talk
where you divulge things?

515
00:26:08,714 --> 00:26:10,978
When people tell me something,
they only tell me.

516
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:13,507
- They don't tell both of us.
- All right, that's cool.

517
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:16,419
I haven't really told anyone.
It would be maybe

518
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:19,549
good to...
I'll tell you.

519
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:22,458
But you can't
tell anybody.

520
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:24,724
Don't worry,
I won't say a word.

521
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:38,171
Hmm, interesting.

522
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,940
So that's who it is.
I'll see you later.

523
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:43,573
- All right, see you later.
- Yeah, bye.

524
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:47,349
What did I miss?

525
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:49,650
She was telling me what songs
she'll do and all that.

526
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:51,178
Oh, okay.

527
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:52,850
I'll make these guys
a sandwich real quick.

528
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:54,722
- Do you want something?
- No.

529
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,387
- No, you're good?
- Yeah.

530
00:26:56,428 --> 00:26:59,420
Okay. Okay.

531
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:01,295
Why don't you guys
come back here with me?

532
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,858
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks. Cool.

533
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:11,498
- Jesus.
- You didn't even freaking look.

534
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:13,306
You come flying
down the hill...

535
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:14,937
You were going a 1,000 miles
an hour on the left side.

536
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,914
What is this, Australia?

537
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:18,974
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay. My neck hurts.

538
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:21,781
This is a Cadillac,
a CTS, a brand new car.

539
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,084
You're trying to sabotage
the event, aren't you?

540
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:26,283
- By the way, thanks for inviting us.
- Freak you!

541
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:28,589
- Freak you!
- Freak you!

542
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:34,866
But this won't work now
the way it once did

543
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:40,236
And I won't keep it up,
even though I would love to

544
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:44,936
Once I know who I'm not,
then I'll know who I am

545
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:47,207
But I know
I won't keep on

546
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:50,772
Playing the victim.

547
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:05,358
Thank you so much.
Under the circumstances...

548
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:07,388
Mindy Reiser's been
snubbing me all night.

549
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:10,094
- She has?
- She won't even look at me.

550
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:12,467
- Because of the Martin Short thing?
- Yeah.

551
00:28:12,504 --> 00:28:16,270
I turned it around,
and then I do it again.

552
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:19,744
I think we have one song left
that was specially requested.

553
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,746
It's called
"You Oughta Know."

554
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,771
It goes something
like this.

555
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:34,587
I want you to know

556
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:39,120
That I'm happy
for you...

557
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:44,635
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me.

558
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:48,696
The best
for you both...

559
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,901
I know who this song
is about.
