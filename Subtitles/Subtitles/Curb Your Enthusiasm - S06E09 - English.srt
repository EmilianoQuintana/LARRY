3
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:15,883
it's a mystery to me--

4
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,249
How could you
have lived

5
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:21,650
- with that maniac
for that long?

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,182
- I don't know.
- Huh?

7
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:26,616
- I don't know.
- How did you do it?

8
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:29,449
'cause, you know, I'm
not that guy anymore.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,783
- No?
- No.

10
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:32,917
Honestly, you don't look
like that guy anymore.

11
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:34,917
Look, look how much
I've changed.

12
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:36,917
- Did I ever dress like this?
- No.

13
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:38,917
- Your shirt's tucked in.
- I'm tucking in.

14
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:41,550
- You've got real shoes on.
- Shoes, slacks.

15
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:44,349
You look like
a real person,

16
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:47,783
- not an eighth-grader
with silly shoes. - yeah.

17
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:50,182
I used to walk around in
sneakers like an eighth-grader.

18
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,750
I have to say,
I love the new Larry.

19
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:55,616
- Really?
- Yeah.

20
00:00:55,716 --> 00:00:57,116
- You know what I wanna do?
- Hmm?

21
00:00:57,249 --> 00:00:58,850
I want to travel
with you--

22
00:00:58,983 --> 00:01:00,483
A little traveling
in europe maybe,

23
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,917
you know, bicycles-- all
that stuff you wanted to do...

24
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:04,750
- Yeah.
- ...that you used to ask me about,

25
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:07,182
and "no no,
I don't wanna do that;

26
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:09,349
there's no golf courses
nearby..."

27
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:11,816
I don't give a shit
about golf anymore.

28
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:13,816
I just want
to be with you.

29
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:18,650
And you know what else? And
I know you love scuba diving.

30
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:21,017
I never did that with you. You
always wanted to go scuba diving.

31
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:23,716
- I know.
- You know, I can't see underwater

32
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:26,550
'cause, you know...
But whatever,

33
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,283
I'll feel around
for the fish, you know.

34
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:32,550
Well, it seems like you've
done a lot of reflecting.

35
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,216
I'm a completely
changed man.

36
00:01:35,383 --> 00:01:37,550
The only vestige
of my old self

37
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,616
is that I've still got
the good breath, you know.

38
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,017
That's the thing
you're keeping?

39
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:44,750
The new Larry's keeping
the minty breath, yeah.

40
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:46,750
The old Larry
you're getting rid of?

41
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:49,182
He's over.
He's over.

42
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,182
You know, he hated
your sister...

43
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:53,750
He did?

44
00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:58,917
You know what?
Forget that Larry.

45
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:01,116
He's dead.
He's dead.

46
00:02:01,216 --> 00:02:03,116
He's completely dead.

47
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:04,950
Anyway,

48
00:02:05,116 --> 00:02:07,816
it's really good
to see you.

49
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:09,683
It is good
to see you too.

50
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:12,483
It's very impressive
that you're--

51
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,383
- Really? - -- that
you're trying. It is.

52
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:18,116
- I really am trying.
- I know. I can see that.

53
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:20,917
- I really am.
- I know.

54
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:23,550
Hey, let's go to the movies
tomorrow night--

55
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,716
Movies, dinner.

56
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,116
Come on, I'll take you out to dinner.

57
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:32,017
Um, I would love to go
to the movies and dinner.

58
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:33,516
Really?

59
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:35,082
Let me just talk
to my therapist

60
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:37,216
and see what she
has to say first.

61
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,182
I just want to make sure
she feels good

62
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:43,783
- about that.
- Mm-hmm.

63
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,683
I'll call my therapist and see
what she says and I'll call you.

64
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:48,383
Great.

65
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,917
Hey, how much are we supposed
to tip the bartender, by the way?

66
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:53,483
Don't they make too much money?
I mean, everybody buys a drink.

67
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,950
They get, what,
20% of every drink?

68
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:57,483
That's insane, isn't it?

69
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,650
Well, they work
really hard.

70
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:05,349
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's good.

71
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:07,850
They're on their feet
all night,

72
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,683
so whatever. Whatever
they make-- good for them.

73
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:14,216
They work hard,
you know.

74
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:18,449
It could not have gone better.

75
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,783
It was amazing.

76
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:21,516
I showed up in--
You know,

77
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,416
I was tucked in,
I had shoes on.

78
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:25,316
She never likes
the way I dress,

79
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:27,783
but she noticed
the tucked-in

80
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,583
and she was very
impressed with that.

81
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:31,416
I looked like a man,
you know.

82
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,650
This is great stuff.
It's great progress.

83
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,750
- Yeah.
- I have to say, it's not surprising,

84
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,017
because I'd like to think
I know what I'm doing.

85
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:41,316
And, oh, I said-- I was
talking about the future--

86
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,116
If we get back together,
what I want to do:

87
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:45,116
I want to travel
with her,

88
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:47,316
you know, on bicycles.

89
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:49,983
Scuba diving-- in a
zillion years wouldn't I go,

90
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:52,416
but, you know what? I would
do it with her. I really would.

91
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:54,416
Be enthusiastic,
but don't make

92
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:56,683
any specific promises
that you can fulfill.

93
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:57,950
That's my own
personal advice.

94
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,149
Geez, I said a lot
of stuff last night.

95
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,950
Let's deal with that
when it arises.

96
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:05,516
Oh, I might be bicycling in
france in a couple of months.

97
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,783
Again, let's focus
on the next stage.

98
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,816
I asked her

99
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,149
to go to the movies
tonight, okay?

100
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:14,816
And the therapist
gave her the green light,

101
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:17,416
so we're going
to dinner and a movie,

102
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:19,583
or a movie and a dinner,
depending on the starting time.

103
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:21,349
Sometimes it works out you
go to a dinner and a movie,

104
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:23,216
sometimes it's better to
have dinner after the movie,

105
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:25,283
- so you have something to talk about.
- Movie, dinner.

106
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:27,283
Let's not even waste time
talking about that.

107
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:28,550
- Movie, dinner.
- Movie, dinner.

108
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,383
So you take her
to a movie--

109
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,082
After you do the movie,
just reach over,

110
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:34,716
grab her hand,
hold it tenderly

111
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,349
and tell her,
"I love you."

112
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:39,983
Really?

113
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:42,349
- Whisper into her ear, "I love you."
- Okay.

114
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,182
At that point
she's feeling vulnerable.

115
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:47,383
And then at dinner-- that's
when you have to up the stakes.

116
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,116
That's when you have to tell her
you want her to move back in with you

117
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:53,017
and she has until monday
to decide,

118
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:55,850
or that's it.

119
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:57,917
It works.
That's all I can say.

120
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:02,917
Wow.
Wow.

121
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:04,650
She might not like it
at first,

122
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,650
but there's one thing
she won't be able to say,

123
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,283
is that the guy who just
said that is a pussy.

124
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:13,017
No one likes a pussy.

125
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:15,550
What, you're getting
a lot of pussy from me?

126
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,017
Not an amount
that is not manageable.

127
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:21,049
That's why
we have to say,

128
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:23,017
"monday is
the cutoff point:

129
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,850
either we're back on,
move back in,

130
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,583
or monday-- whew."

131
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,650
Okay okay.
I think I got it.

132
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,116
Although I gotta say,

133
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:35,017
being a pussy really
wasn't my problem with her.

134
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:37,017
It was more the fact
that I was selfish

135
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:39,017
- and kind of thoughtless...
- We have to stop.

136
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:42,616
Oh, okay.

137
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:46,650
Huh.
I thought I had...

138
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,483
We have to stop.

139
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:53,017
Go, whew--
Go get 'em.

140
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:54,783
Okay.

141
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,583
Je t'aime.

142
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,750
Je t'aime aussi...

143
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,017
I love you.

144
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,683
I gotta tell ya, the new
Larry is really working for me.

145
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:43,683
Let me tell you
something, okay?

146
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:46,583
The new Larry can really
make you happy.

147
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,483
I really can.
I know I can.

148
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,483
Just the idea of you
wanting me to be happy

149
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,683
is amazing.

150
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:56,283
Not just happy, but
really, like, delirious.

151
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,850
- Delirious?
- Delirious.

152
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,049
hi.
- What a surprise!

153
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:04,416
Is this
what I think it is?

154
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:06,416
Well, we're just...

155
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:08,616
- Having dinner.
- ...having dinner, talking.

156
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:11,483
This is
one great picture.

157
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,583
I love it.

158
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,316
It's good
to see you guys.

159
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,950
Hey, can I ask you
for a quick favor?

160
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:21,850
Nan's dad dan
has alzheimer's...

161
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,683
Really?
oh.

162
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,283
We're having a five-mile
walkathon at venice beach.

163
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,116
I need you to sponsor me.
Jeff's doing it.

164
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,316
$50 a mile--
250 bucks.

165
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:32,950
So you want me
to sponsor you?

166
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:34,616
Yeah, sure.
250 bucks.

167
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,416
"Larry david,"
right there.

168
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,316
It's worth it,
believe me.

169
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,783
You don't know
what alzheimer's is.

170
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:41,683
- He's got it bad.
- Really?

171
00:07:41,783 --> 00:07:43,149
What does he do?

172
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:45,149
He runs around the house
all day naked,

173
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:47,149
chasing himself,
playing tag.

174
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:48,783
- It's awful.
- Really truly?

175
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,883
He screams at the cat
'cause she didn't vote.

176
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:52,950
Wow.

177
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:55,516
Every time he farts, he
calls the fire department.

178
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,883
Just sign it, please.
Don't make me beg you.

179
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:00,883
You know...

180
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:03,783
It is a great cause.

181
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,550
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

182
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:08,516
- That's great.
- Of course. It's a damn good cause.

183
00:08:08,616 --> 00:08:11,349
- Oh, thank you, honey. Whoa.
- Thank you very much.

184
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,449
- Yeah.
- There you go-- 250 bucks.

185
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:15,883
- Thank you, Larry.
- Great to see you too again.

186
00:08:15,983 --> 00:08:17,149
It's good to see you guys.

187
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,983
Thanks.

188
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:21,349
It's so nice of you
to sponsor him.

189
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,349
Come on, what is it?
$250?

190
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:26,616
I know, but I feel like
usually you would complain

191
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,716
or, I don't know,
give him a hard time, but...

192
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,616
- Old Larry.
- I know.

193
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:34,349
I feel like you are
a different person.

194
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:37,383
Honey, I am
a different person.

195
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:41,449
I'm so different.

196
00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:43,650
Listen...

197
00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:49,616
I want you
to move back in with me.

198
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:53,316
You have till monday

199
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,783
to decide.

200
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:57,783
Monday?

201
00:08:57,883 --> 00:09:00,883
Yeah, monday.

202
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:02,983
Then the offer's
off the table.

203
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:09,416
You're giving me
an ultimatum?

204
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:10,883
What...?

205
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,716
- Oh my god. You know what?
- Oh, okay.

206
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,650
- You don't have to wait till monday.
- Okay, so...

207
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:16,983
- Guess what? The answer is no.
- Okay, there's no ultimatum.

208
00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:19,516
- You're never going to change, Larry.
- Take your time.

209
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,816
- You obviously have no idea.
- Take a month, I don't care.

210
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:23,816
- Don't call me, please, ever.
- What?

211
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,249
no!

212
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:28,616
Hey, Cheryl.

213
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,716
Cheryl.

214
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:32,716
Cheryl, the therapist
told me to say that.

215
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:34,783
- Oh, really?
- I want you to move in. I do love you.

216
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:36,983
You know what, Larry? I thought
the new Larry didn't lie.

217
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:38,983
- I'm not lying.
- Oh, really?

218
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,349
The therapist said that.
He gave me the deadline.

219
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:43,516
I'm so stupid. I was
actually believing you.

220
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,416
No, believe me.
That was all true,

221
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:47,182
except for
the deadline part.

222
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:49,249
The therapist told me
to say that.

223
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:50,716
Cheryl!

224
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:53,550
But the deadline--

225
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,816
Agh! Agh!

226
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:58,283
Agh-hh!

227
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,383
oh.

228
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:03,082
You ruined my life.

229
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:06,283
You ruined
my life, okay?

230
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:08,816
- Okay.
- Give her an ultimatum?

231
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,349
- Whoa, okay.
- What the fuck was that?

232
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:14,449
- I was this close, this close!
- Larry, you're angry.

233
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,983
She's gone.

234
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,449
It's a setback.
It's a setback.

235
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:21,116
I told you she wasn't bothered
by the high pussy percentage,

236
00:10:21,283 --> 00:10:23,483
- but you didn't listen to me.
- We ran out of time.

237
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,416
I had to see someone else
who was suicidal.

238
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,249
You know what we're gointo do
now? We're going to go to her house

239
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,883
and you're going to tell her that
the whole thing was your idea.

240
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,283
Okay, let's have
a session.

241
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,149
No, I don't want
to have a session.

242
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:39,316
You're going to tell her that you told
me to give her that stupid ultimatum.

243
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,316
Larry?

244
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,283
Sorry for popping in
on you like this.

245
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,950
- Hello, I'm Dr. Bright.
- This is my therapist.

246
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,683
- Hi, I'm Cheryl.
- Could we come in

247
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:53,716
- and talk to you for just a few minutes?
- Larry...

248
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,483
It won't take long.

249
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:58,516
I guess so.

250
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,616
Come on in.

251
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:02,883
Thanks.

252
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,049
Wow.

253
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:10,883
You're on the ocean?

254
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:12,049
Yeah.

255
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:14,049
Wow, this is...

256
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:16,783
These places are expensive,
on the water, aren't they?

257
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,783
My therapist said

258
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,583
that I should do
something nice for myself,

259
00:11:21,683 --> 00:11:23,683
sort of a love-me gift.

260
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,416
And I decided,
you know what?

261
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:27,449
I've always wanted
to live on the beach.

262
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:29,616
I can do it now,
so...

263
00:11:29,716 --> 00:11:31,983
- Very good advice.
- Yeah.

264
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,983
Oh, you think so?

265
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:35,783
mm.

266
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,416
I don't remember you telling
me to get any love-me gifts.

267
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,683
- We were moving onto that at some point.
- Oh, really?

268
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,116
- We would have arrived at that.
- Oh, interesting.

269
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:45,850
So what do you guys
need to tell me?

270
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:48,516
- Go ahead, bright.
- Okay.

271
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:52,049
I gave Larry
some flawed advice.

272
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:54,049
I told Larry to give you an ultimatum.

273
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,583
He told me
to say that.

274
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:57,149
You told him
to say that?

275
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,082
Yeah, because the picture
that was painted of you

276
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:02,082
was not the person
I'm seeing--

277
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:04,816
- What? - well, no no
no. I mean that you--

278
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,816
What does that mean?

279
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,249
I think--
I don't know.

280
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,249
I just had--
It means nothing.

281
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,716
- What did you think?
- I thought maybe

282
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:14,149
you were the kind of person
who would like an ultimatum.

283
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:17,316
- And you're not, clearly.
- What kind of picture are you painting of me?

284
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,516
Just a loving
portrayal.

285
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:21,850
It was-- it was a
deeply loving portrayal.

286
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:23,216
But-- but--

287
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:24,883
What have I been saying
about her?

288
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:27,249
You didn't describe her
physically--

289
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,116
So I didn't know
what she looked like.

290
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,950
That's why I'm just saying,
whoo! I'm just impressed.

291
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:34,516
Why would it matter what
somebody looks like physically--

292
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,917
- What kind of advice-- ? - because
you get the face you deserve, right?

293
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:40,883
The face tells a story.

294
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:42,883
All right, all right.
The point is,

295
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:45,716
you get an idea of the person
who I've been listening to here?

296
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:47,816
- Is it coming through to you?
- Yeah.

297
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,149
So you told Larry
to give me an ultimatum.

298
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:51,449
Fine, okay.
Now I know that.

299
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,550
- Okay?
- He is to blame.

300
00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:55,550
I'm 90% to blame
for everything.

301
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:58,816
90%? I think 100%. 100% to blame.

302
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,816
Well, I'm taking
a lion's share.

303
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,449
No, take more than a lion's
share. Take the whole share.

304
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,416
Take it all.

305
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:07,750
Okay, all right.
No, that's fair.

306
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:09,750
Yeah, I'm 100% to blame.

307
00:13:09,816 --> 00:13:11,750
I told Larry
to do the--

308
00:13:11,883 --> 00:13:13,449
To hold your hand,
to say, "I love you."

309
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,082
- The new Larry-- it's all
me. - all right, no no no.

310
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:17,650
The new Larry is you?

311
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,616
What?
What did you say?

312
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,783
You're not responsible
for the new Larry.

313
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:23,716
I'm the new-- you didn't
make the new Larry.

314
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:25,283
You told me
to take 100%.

315
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:26,983
I invented the new Larry,
not you.

316
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:28,883
What about tucking in
the t-shirt?

317
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:30,783
You didn't tell me--
You told me to tuck in?

318
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:33,049
All right, I understand
what you're saying.

319
00:13:33,182 --> 00:13:35,349
I'm going to talk
to Dr. Salvin

320
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,182
and figure it out,
so thanks.

321
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,182
All right.
Okay.

322
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:41,349
All right, thanks for coming, I guess.

323
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:42,850
Why are you taking
credit for new Larry?

324
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,383
I laid the foundation
for new Larry.

325
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:46,449
Bullshit--
You laid foundation.

326
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:51,116
You're a moron. How could
you suggest such a thing?

327
00:13:51,182 --> 00:13:52,750
It's not
an exact science.

328
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,182
- And I mean...
- Clearly.

329
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:58,082
I mean, that is unbelievable, seriously.

330
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:00,383
The thing about it
is that...

331
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:03,917
She doesn't make a move now
in her life

332
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:06,017
unless her therapist
tells her.

333
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:09,283
But the therapist doesn't
know anything about me.

334
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,416
- I'm not represented there.
- No, you're not.

335
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,283
If the therapist knew me, okay?

336
00:14:15,383 --> 00:14:17,850
If the therapist thought
I was a terrific guy,

337
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,182
- there would be a counterargument to it.
- Right.

338
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:22,216
How do you get to her?

339
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:29,850
I got it.
Let's go.

340
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,850
Come on.

341
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:34,283
- Come on, bright.
- Yeah, thank you.

342
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:36,650
So you jump out,

343
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:38,917
you grab
the therapist's purse.

344
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:40,917
Then I come
out of nowhere,

345
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:43,883
I tackle you,
take you down,

346
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,883
get the purse
from you.

347
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:47,917
You run off,
you get yourself

348
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:50,283
a cup of coffee,
a piece of pizza.

349
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:52,550
And I return
the handbag

350
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:57,049
and I'm like a god,
you know.

351
00:14:57,216 --> 00:14:58,650
Pshh, I'll do that shit.

352
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,082
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I'll do it. What the fuck?

353
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:02,483
You're my motherfucking man,
Larry.

354
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,017
Is he the greatest?
Are you the greatest, man?

355
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:07,216
- What's up? That's how we do it, yo.
- You are the greatest.

356
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:08,583
That's how we
fucking do it.

357
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,182
I walk by,
I grab the fucking purse.

358
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:12,116
I run down the street,
Larry pops the fuck out,

359
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:13,983
tackles me, tries to get the purse back.

360
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:16,082
I fuck Larry up,
I keep on rolling.

361
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,850
You--

362
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,449
Somebody gotta get
fucked up, Larry, right?

363
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,149
You don't need to-- what
are you saying, fuck me up?

364
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:24,950
When you tackle me I ain't going to
look like a fucking bitch and shit,

365
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,416
- let you fuck me up.
- No. I tackle you

366
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:28,316
and then you run away.
You run away.

367
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,683
The more fucked up you are, the more
of a hero you're gonna look like.

368
00:15:30,783 --> 00:15:32,850
I'm going to break your fucking
teeth, your glasses or something.

369
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:35,116
Leon, I don't need to look
like that much of a hero.

370
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:37,316
Just stopping you and giving
her her purse back's enough.

371
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:39,283
There's no way in hell. You
can't do that shit half-speed.

372
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:41,550
It's not realistic, Larry,
if I don't fuck you up.

373
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,017
- Hey, who's this?
- Hello, I'm Dr. Bright.

374
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:48,116
That's my therapist
I was telling you about.

375
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:50,116
- Oh, is this Mr. Ultimatum?
- Yeah.

376
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:53,249
Yo, man, that idea you
came up with was awful.

377
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,783
So what's
going on, l.d.?

378
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:58,216
Nothing.
Nothing really.

379
00:15:58,383 --> 00:16:00,483
What's happening?
What's happening, Leon?

380
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:05,049
- Larry wants me to mug somebody.
- Who? Who?

381
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,483
- Yeah, but it's a pretend mugging.
- It's pretend.

382
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,683
It's all for fun.

383
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:10,516
I know you're not
going along with that.

384
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,216
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.
I'ma grab the fucking purse...

385
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:15,416
- Leon!
- ...Larry's going to jump out and try to stop me,

386
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,383
- I'ma fuck Larry up...
- You're not gonna fuck me up.

387
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:21,049
- You done lost your mind, Leon.
- You done lost your mind.

388
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:28,349
He's not doing it!

389
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:29,783
You know what?

390
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,983
This pasty-ass motherfucker
got you into it.

391
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,082
Have him get your ass
out of it.

392
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:40,017
She's right.

393
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:42,017
I'll do it.

394
00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:44,616
Eh, fuck it.

395
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:50,349
There's her therapist.

396
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:52,983
Okay okay, that's her.
You see her?

397
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:54,783
Yeah, okay.
All right, let's go.

398
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,550
What are you doing?
What is this?

399
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,983
You look like a rapist with that
thing on. You don't need that.

400
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,816
You know what?
Put the hood up.

401
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:02,550
Isn't that a cliche?

402
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,449
- It's not a cliche. Put the hood up.
- All right.

403
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,850
All right, good.
What?

404
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:08,816
I've changed my mind. I
can't do it. I can't do it.

405
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:12,082
Go do it.

406
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:15,017
- Give me your bag. I'm mugging you.
- No. No.

407
00:17:15,082 --> 00:17:16,383
I got it!
I got it!

408
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,149
Oh my god.

409
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:21,249
Oh my god.

410
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:25,716
Now run!

411
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:27,182
- Thank you.
- You'd better run!

412
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,182
Oh my...

413
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,182
Here you are.

414
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,216
Thank you.

415
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:35,650
That was amazing.
You came out of nowhere.

416
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:37,750
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- I didn't even see you.

417
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,550
Yeah, we're--
We're okay.

418
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,182
Do what
you have to do.

419
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:45,483
How did you--
How did you do that?

420
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:47,550
I never even saw you--

421
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:50,650
What was I going to do?
I saw that

422
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:53,383
and I had
to do something.

423
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:55,449
I can't believe
what I just witnessed.

424
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,449
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

425
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,816
Well, you're welcome.

426
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:01,283
You take good care
of yourself, okay?

427
00:18:01,383 --> 00:18:02,917
Thank you.
I'm a little shaken.

428
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,017
Shake it off. Go get
yourself a drink or something.

429
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:06,449
- Yeah.
- Okay.

430
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,950
Wait, I never even
asked your name.

431
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,216
It's Larry--

432
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:18,750
Larry david.

433
00:18:20,383 --> 00:18:22,182
Larry david?

434
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,383
Very funny.
Spread your legs.

435
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:30,182
That was amazing. I
mean, the way you swept in

436
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:32,483
and took control--
That didn't seem real.

437
00:18:32,616 --> 00:18:35,550
It was real.
I can tell you that.

438
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,616
I'm still a little shaky, I guess.

439
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,116
- It's to be expected.
My god. - that guy--

440
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:43,950
- That strange, horrible man...
- Horrible.

441
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:46,683
But you were just like
clint eastwood.

442
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,783
I mean, you just
swept in there and...

443
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,483
I have never seen
anything that brave.

444
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,483
Eh, please, really.

445
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,650
I didn't even
think twice about it.

446
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,583
The only thing I did think about
for a second was my glasses,

447
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:02,116
but that's it-- only
the safety of my glasses.

448
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:04,583
'cause these are
irreplaceable.

449
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,917
What do you do,
may I ask?

450
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:08,950
Oh, I'm a therapist.

451
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:10,483
- You're a therapist?
- Yes.

452
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,149
Oh, boy, I could really
use a therapist myself.

453
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:16,883
My wife left me
after a long time and--

454
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:19,316
I'm not going to bother you
with all this, you know.

455
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,316
That's all right.
Please.

456
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:24,850
Well, my wife
left the house recently

457
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,683
and it's been
quite devas--

458
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:30,383
- I'm sure it's-- - it's
been quite devastating for me,

459
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:31,783
but anyway...

460
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,316
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

461
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:35,783
But I feel like
she never really

462
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,049
had any idea
who I was.

463
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:40,049
All this time,
all these years,

464
00:19:40,116 --> 00:19:42,383
I really hid
the real me,

465
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,182
the me who saves people.

466
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:48,983
And, you know, I have been
doing that most of my life.

467
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,149
You know, I gave
a kidney to my friend...

468
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:53,049
Oh, I didn't know that.

469
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:54,616
Why would you?

470
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:58,216
No, I wouldn't.
I just--

471
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:00,783
All right, well,
I gotta go.

472
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:03,483
You are
such a good person.

473
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,950
Do you know that?

474
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:07,950
- Am I?
- Oh...

475
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,683
Yes.

476
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:13,316
Okay.

477
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,416
So great
to have met you.

478
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:16,583
Yes.

479
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,750
I'd better get going.

480
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:23,416
You take care
of yourself.

481
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:25,716
Well, thanks again.

482
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:28,783
So long.

483
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:31,583
Goodbye, Larry david.

484
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:39,783
Oh, wow.
Hey.

485
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:46,516
How are you doing?

486
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:49,149
Well, I'm in prison.

487
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,216
Yeah. Jesus.

488
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,883
I spent the night
in a cell

489
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:55,516
that's smaller
than my closet.

490
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:58,316
Oh, man, oh, man.
I'm so sorry.

491
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:00,082
My feet stick out
through the fucking bars.

492
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:01,950
- Your feet stick out?
- Yeah, my feet stick out.

493
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:03,983
- You're not even that tall.
- I know. I know.

494
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:06,216
I'm not even that tall, and
my fucking feet stick out.

495
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,216
- How tall are you?
- 5'10".

496
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:09,583
- You're 5'10"?
- Yeah.

497
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:12,716
You're 5'10"?
Stand up. Let me see.

498
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,316
- You're not 5'10".
- I'm 5'10", I am.

499
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,616
Well, a hairsbreadth
under.

500
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:19,616
You're cheating a little bit.
I don't think you're 5'10".

501
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:21,483
In the heel, I am--
That's not the point.

502
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:23,149
The point is
I'm sharing a room

503
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:26,249
with a 300-lb fucking guy
with a hairy back.

504
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,883
Sometimes you make friends
in a situation like this.

505
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:30,716
They become
your friend for life.

506
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:32,917
He doesn't
speak english.

507
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:35,616
Okay, all right.

508
00:21:35,716 --> 00:21:39,349
Oh, good news:

509
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:41,816
after you were
taken away...

510
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:45,316
...the therapist and I
went to have coffee--

511
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,182
Whew, the plan worked
fantastic.

512
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,316
I'm pretty optimistic.
And you know what?

513
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:53,149
Thank you. 'cause you were
there at its inception.

514
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:55,249
You pushed it through.

515
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,149
I'm very happy for you,

516
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:00,550
but it's not top of the list
of my priorities right now.

517
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:03,516
We're going to get you out
of here. Don't worry about it.

518
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,283
Do we have a time frame?
Can you give me a time frame?

519
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:08,182
- 24 hours...
- Okay, I think I can--

520
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:10,917
...48 at the most.

521
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:13,449
- What's after 48? 72?
- 72, yeah.

522
00:22:13,616 --> 00:22:16,783
58, 68-- right,
72. And then...

523
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:18,349
Don't say "and then..."

524
00:22:18,449 --> 00:22:20,816
What do you mean, 72?
That's beyond what--

525
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:22,616
...96?

526
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,716
Please, let's aim
for 24.

527
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:26,349
You got
a deck of cards?

528
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:28,249
Can you play solitaire or
anything? What can you do here?

529
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,883
I don't have a deck of cards, but
yes, I do know how to play solitaire.

530
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,249
I should have brought a deck of
cards. Damn it. It's always good

531
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:35,550
to have a deck of cards,
no matter where you are.

532
00:22:35,716 --> 00:22:38,550
What are you talking about? Just
get me out of fucking prison.

533
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,983
I'm not talking
about cards.

534
00:22:40,116 --> 00:22:41,750
Just get me out of
fucking prison, please.

535
00:22:41,883 --> 00:22:44,483
I'm sorry,
we're going to have to stop.

536
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,116
We have more time.

537
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,850
Cheryl's getting out
of her therapy appointment

538
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:50,316
and I really need
to talk to her.

539
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:52,917
I've not spoken to
anyone normal in 24 hours

540
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:54,583
and I'm scared.

541
00:22:54,683 --> 00:22:56,716
We have to stop.

542
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,249
- Hello?
- Oh, hi, Cheryl.

543
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:08,283
How did your session
go today?

544
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:10,383
Larry, I've spoken
to my therapist

545
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,149
and she told me I shouldn't
ever be speaking to you again.

546
00:23:13,249 --> 00:23:15,149
She said that?

547
00:23:15,283 --> 00:23:17,650
Yeah. I'm sorry,
Larry, really.

548
00:23:17,783 --> 00:23:19,683
Are you kidding?

549
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,616
I should go. I should
go. Goodbye, Larry.

550
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:23,716
Hey, Cheryl!

551
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:38,516
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

552
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,750
Excuse me.

553
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:47,383
- Hey.
- You're not gonna believe this:

554
00:23:47,449 --> 00:23:49,383
Cheryl called me up,
told me

555
00:23:49,516 --> 00:23:51,383
that her therapist
urged her--

556
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:53,716
Urged her
never to see me again.

557
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:55,716
That makes
no sense whatsoever.

558
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:58,616
- Oh my god.
- Huh?

559
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:00,082
What?

560
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:01,416
She likes me.

561
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,716
Her therapist likes me.

562
00:24:05,283 --> 00:24:07,349
That's why she told Cheryl
not to see me.

563
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:09,049
She wants me for herself.

564
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:12,349
- Oh my god! Oh my god!
- Huh?

565
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:14,650
What am I going to do?

566
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,650
If I reject her,

567
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,716
she'll say bad things
about me to Cheryl.

568
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,850
And if I'm nice to her,
she'll think I'm interested.

569
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:24,716
Oh, you are screwed.

570
00:24:24,816 --> 00:24:26,883
I've got to get out of
this. What am I going to do?

571
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:28,449
I think you're fucked.
That's what I think.

572
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,182
Tommy!

573
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:32,883
- Is that funkhouser?
- Yeah.

574
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:36,182
What is he doing here?
He's supposed to be walking.

575
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:37,516
He's having
a cup of coffee?

576
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,082
I'll see you later.

577
00:24:39,182 --> 00:24:40,616
Hey.

578
00:24:40,716 --> 00:24:42,283
L.d., how are
you doing, pal?

579
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,283
Where's your shirt?

580
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,750
What are you doing? You're
supposed to be walking.

581
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,850
I raised money.
I don't walk.

582
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,483
You didn't tell me
you were sitting.

583
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,917
I wouldn't have given you
money in the fist place.

584
00:24:54,017 --> 00:24:56,650
- I didn't say I was walking.
- The walking's implied, is it not?

585
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,283
No, I said, "sponsor
me for the walkathon."

586
00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:01,550
Okay, walkathon--
Walk.

587
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,483
Why do you want me
to walk?

588
00:25:03,616 --> 00:25:06,283
You took money
under false pretenses.

589
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:08,850
So you don't care
about alzheimer's?

590
00:25:11,383 --> 00:25:13,383
Alzheimer's?

591
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,550
You were diagnosed
with alzheimer's?!

592
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,182
Yeah, and you're
the first person I've told.

593
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:24,116
I haven't told anybody.

594
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:25,683
You're the only one
who knows.

595
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:29,383
- So this is just the very earliest onset?
- Yeah.

596
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:31,850
I mean, it's not early.
I'm sort of halfway

597
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,950
between early and middle.
What's that called?

598
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:35,750
I don't know if there's
a term for that.

599
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,316
Maybe I have a quarter...?

600
00:25:39,483 --> 00:25:41,483
I have to
confess something.

601
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,017
After we met
and connected,

602
00:25:44,116 --> 00:25:47,017
I was hoping that,
you know,

603
00:25:47,116 --> 00:25:49,483
maybe there was
some kind of future.

604
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:54,216
In three to five years
I'll be a vegetable.

605
00:25:55,483 --> 00:25:57,316
Listen, you helped me
the other day

606
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:59,683
and I want to help you.

607
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,583
I forgot your name.

608
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,550
You must go back
with your wife.

609
00:26:04,683 --> 00:26:07,483
Hearing this news-- you
must go back with your wife.

610
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:10,283
Oh my god. Yes, I know,
but what can you do?

611
00:26:10,383 --> 00:26:13,950
Well, you never know.

612
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:17,017
Let's order.
I'm getting hungry.

613
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:19,583
- We did order.
- We did?

614
00:26:19,683 --> 00:26:21,650
Yeah, you had
the chicken salad.

615
00:26:21,816 --> 00:26:24,950
- I ordered chicken salad?
- Yeah. Do you not like-- ?

616
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:27,416
- I don't even like chicken salad.
- Oh my god.

617
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,750
- God damn it.
- No no no, we'll switch.

618
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,249
- Excuse me, Dr. Salvin?
- Oh, yes.

619
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,017
I'm detective kennan,
l.a.p.d.

620
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:37,316
I talked to your assistant.
She told me I could

621
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:39,049
find you here
with Mr. David.

622
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:41,516
I have some questions
about your purse-snatching.

623
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,216
Now I understand you didn't get a
look at the guy, but that you did.

624
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:45,950
We actually have
the guy already.

625
00:26:46,116 --> 00:26:48,483
I just want some basic
information so we can keep him.

626
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,149
So, what did he
look like?

627
00:26:54,483 --> 00:26:57,383
I-- I don't remember.

628
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,750
Aw, jeez.

629
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:13,149
There he is.
There's my guy.

630
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:16,216
Hey ya, bright.
Hey ya, bright boy.

631
00:27:16,316 --> 00:27:17,616
Huh?

632
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:19,616
How's it going?

633
00:27:19,783 --> 00:27:21,049
Uh, not too good.

634
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:23,950
What's the matter?
You seem a little down.

635
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:26,516
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with my life.

636
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,049
- Really?
- Yeah.

637
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,049
Oh, hey, get this:

638
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,783
I'm going out with Cheryl tonight.
I've got a date with Cheryl.

639
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,049
- Good.
- It's fantastic. I'm so thrilled.

640
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:36,883
Come on. I'm pretty excited, bright.

641
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:38,716
I think
it's going to work out.

642
00:27:47,616 --> 00:27:49,516
You did it.
That was--

643
00:27:49,616 --> 00:27:50,883
There you go,
big winner.

644
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:52,416
Hey...

645
00:27:52,516 --> 00:27:54,416
That is so sweet.
Thank you.

646
00:27:54,516 --> 00:27:56,750
- Let's go on the ferris wheel.
- Okay.

647
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:04,017
It's the most
bizarre experience of my life

648
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,783
and I just need someone
to speak to about it

649
00:28:06,883 --> 00:28:09,816
because I can't work
and I can't sleep.

650
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:11,983
And you come
highly recommended.

651
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:15,783
Why don't you start
from the beginning?

652
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:18,449
Um, well,
one of my clients

653
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:22,783
is this bald guy, um...

654
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:26,449
I want you
to move back in with me.

655
00:28:26,516 --> 00:28:28,983
You have till monday
to decide.

656
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,783
Okay.

657
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,883
- Really?
- Yeah.

658
00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:35,883
- I love you, Larry.
- I love you.

659
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,182
Hello?
Hi, Dr. Salvin.

660
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:44,349
ah.
