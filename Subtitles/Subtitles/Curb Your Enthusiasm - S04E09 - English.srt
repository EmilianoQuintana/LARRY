0
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,073
I don't know why I ever married
this man. What a schmuck.

1
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,643
Shlomo, what is taking you
so long?! My God!

2
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,086
What the hell are you doing?!
Get out here!

3
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,250
You are such schmuck!
Can't you do anything right?

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,156
Is it so hard
to keep this with that?

5
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,060
Putz.
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,259
I'm sorry about that.
Have a good day.

7
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,232
Larry, hmm?

8
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,570
How are you, Anna?

9
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,337
Oh, I'm just
never been better.

10
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,344
So what could I do
for you, my friend?

11
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,369
Well, got a
little suit here...

12
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,678
needs a cleaning.

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,651
My wife and I
are renewing our vows.

14
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,880
- 10 years we've been married.
- Oy.

15
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:00,090
Wow. I bet you
make her very happy.

16
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,357
No, she's the most miserable
woman in the world, believe me.

17
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,832
You're pretty fit,
Larry.

18
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,130
How you stay so fit?
What do you do?

19
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:13,105
I run away from hoodlums...
it keeps you in shape.

20
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,968
So what do you think,
you can get this...

21
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,036
get this done
for me for...

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,480
oh, I need it by...

23
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,540
oh no, I got that dinner party...
tomorrow?

24
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,950
You could have whatever
you like, Larry.

25
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,718
So do I need a ticket
or anything?

26
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,555
I know you, Larry.

27
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,323
You don't need
no ticket.

28
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,193
Okay.

29
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,840
Larry.

30
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,608
- Rabbi.
- We got a cantor already. It's okay.

31
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,638
Huh, you got... can I be
the new cantor?

32
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,241
- I think I can do it.
- Can you do it?

33
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,478
I think I could.

34
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,419
So you ready
for the big day?

35
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,046
I'm all ready
for Saturday.

36
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,886
I want to thank you
for doing this.

37
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,892
- It's a pleasure. It's a pleasure.
- Yes.

38
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,087
- It should be painless. I promise.
- Okay.

39
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,426
Looking
forward to it.

40
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,193
Is that you?

41
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,633
That's, uh...
that's Eddie Silverman.

42
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,432
He's my
brother-in-law.

43
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,166
He, uh...

44
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,739
he died on
September 11th.

45
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,939
Oh my gosh.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,447
Yeah.
Terrible.

47
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,415
He was
in the building?

48
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,716
No no, he was uptown
on 57th Street.

49
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,784
He got hit
by a bike messenger.

50
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,757
- It's awful.
- Uptown?

51
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,729
Yeah. Yeah.

52
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,495
It was...
bike messenger hit him.

53
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,768
- What a shame.
- Yeah yeah.

54
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,839
Well, that's, uh...

55
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,746
- Hey, Rabbi?
- Yeah?

56
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:07,219
Um, can I discuss

57
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,744
a private matter
with you?

58
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,689
Please. Anything.
I'm a rabbi.

59
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,715
Anything
you want to say.

60
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,287
10 years ago
before we got married...

61
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,298
my wife told me

62
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,892
that if we stayed
together for 10 years,

63
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,903
that for our
10th anniversary,

64
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,996
as a present to me,

65
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,667
she would let me
have...

66
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,972
relations with another
woman...

67
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,671
just one time.

68
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,942
And this is like...
this is a gift to you?

69
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:39,042
- It's like I have total permission.
- Yeah?

70
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,144
She's almost kind of
challenging me in a way,

71
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,315
in a kind of demeaning way,
she doesn't think I'm suave enough.

72
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,222
- Oh really?
- And I want to.

73
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,057
It's the only opportunity
I'll have for the rest of my life.

74
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,893
I've never cheated on her,
I never would cheat.

75
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,398
This is all
on the up and up.

76
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,402
- So you're conflicted about it?
- Yes, yet I kind of...

77
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,597
I'll be honest,
it would be nice.

78
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,629
You know what comes
to my mind, Larry?

79
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,164
What comes to my mind

80
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,302
is the story
of Abraham and Sarah.

81
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:09,714
Sarah could not conceive
and said to Abraham,

82
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,185
"Go in to your
handmaiden Hagar,

83
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,551
and have
relations with her."

84
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,988
Abraham's wife
said that to him?

85
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,151
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Get the hell outta here!

86
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,717
It's right there
in Genesis.

87
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:26,095
I think that you can look at that
as a very real precedent.

88
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,191
This woman's never gonna
replace your wife.

89
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:31,101
- She's not gonna mean anything.
- Of course not.

90
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,662
- So I mean there's no danger of that?
- No!

91
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,004
It's not an act
of love anyway.

92
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,306
- It's lust.
- So... so you know...

93
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,211
"Love"...I don't know what that
has to do with sex?

94
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,580
- Yeah, well it has a lot to do, but...
- Yeah, for sure.

95
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,246
I would say that she's giving you
something out of generosity

96
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,051
and I think you
should probably

97
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,354
accept it in that
same sense of generosity.

98
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,191
And I'm not a bad person
if I do it?

99
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,958
No no, you're not
a bad person if you...

100
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,828
I'm a bad person anyway,
but I'm not...

101
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,663
am I an extra
bad person?

102
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,295
No, it does not make you
an extra bad person.

103
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,832
I've got to start
coming to temple more often.

104
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,172
I'm glad I could
be helpful with this.

105
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,302
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

106
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,370
You're very welcome.
You're very welcome.

107
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,143
I'll see you tomorrow
night for dinner?

108
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,650
Yes, I'm looking forward to that.
Oh listen, Larry,

109
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,744
I was talking
to a friend of mine,

110
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,620
and, uh...
he's a survivor,

111
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,124
and he would love
to meet you.

112
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,525
Would it be possible for me
to bring him to dinner?

113
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,859
- Of course!
- I don't want to impose or anything.

114
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,296
There's no
imposition at all.

115
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,129
Bring him over.
That's fine.

116
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,692
- That's wonderful.
- It's just going to be my family.

117
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,567
- He'll be thrilled.
- It's not a big deal.

118
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,697
- Okay.
- All right.

119
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,265
Go, enjoy.

120
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,435
Rabbi, thank you.

121
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,774
Okay.

122
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,415
Yes, Your Honor, I do admit
for the last 20 years

123
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,817
I've been a lying,
double-crossing, two-faced...

124
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,723
- Just stop it! I can't stand it!
- Call a truce.

125
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,626
All right?
All Summer.

126
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,467
- How's it going?
- It's not going well.

127
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,166
I'm trying to memorize
this stuff,

128
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,175
they're making
a racket.

129
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,975
- I've got two weeks.
- You're doing great.

130
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,207
I'm gonna be
humiliated.

131
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:26,150
Oh, the rabbi said he's bringing
a survivor tomorrow.

132
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,382
Should I have my father
bring his friend Solly,

133
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,014
who's also a survivor...

134
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,957
- the guy with the glass eye?
- Oh, right.

135
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,516
- Remember him?
- Yeah.

136
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,289
You think that's
a good idea?

137
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,229
Do survivors like
seeing each other?

138
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,232
Do they like to talk
about old times

139
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,758
or does the sight of another
survivor depress them?

140
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,566
I think you
should invite him.

141
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,835
- Invite him.
- I guess if I was a survivor,

142
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,934
- I'd want to see somebody...
- Somebody you have a shared experience.

143
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,605
Yeah, talk about...
see that's the thing.

144
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,978
Do they want to...
I don't know.

145
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,279
How are your vows
coming along?

146
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,445
I just haven't had
that much time

147
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,921
- to really work on it yet.
- This is important to me.

148
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,924
The whole thing's
gonna be embarrassing.

149
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,450
You didn't tell me this was gonna be part of
the whole thing... that I'd have

150
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:14,023
- to say this in front of people.
- Okay, I'm giving you a good gift.

151
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,092
Okay, so this is
what I have so far.

152
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,672
"May I always have the wisdom
to look past your shortcomings

153
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,369
and appreciate all of the goodness
you possess.

154
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,744
We promise to continue
loving each other unconditionally,

155
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,045
not only throughout
this lifetime,

156
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,483
but after death
through all eternity.

157
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,113
- We stand before you..."
- Huh? Wait a second.

158
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,484
- What?
- What was that about eternity?

159
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,085
Um...

160
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,654
"We'll love each other
throughout this lifetime,

161
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,757
but after death,
through all eternity."

162
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,997
You mean this is...

163
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,473
this is continuing
into the afterlife?

164
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,177
Yeah, that's the idea.

165
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,669
- Do you have a problem with that?
- Well, l...

166
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,575
I thought this
was over at death.

167
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,747
I didn't know we went
into eternity together.

168
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,349
l... isn't that
what it said in...

169
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,416
"till death do us part,"
I thought it was...

170
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,894
- You have a problem with eternity?!
- Well...

171
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,760
We finally found
each other, Larry,

172
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,733
and we're celebrating
this for all eternity.

173
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:26,101
I just... I guess I had
a different plan for eternity.

174
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,537
I thought...

175
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,370
I thought I'd be single,
I guess.

176
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,376
I'm sorry.
I'm interrupting

177
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,708
your single life
in eternity?

178
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:37,079
No, I just didn't
realize that...

179
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,813
this relationship
carried over after death.

180
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,583
Well, it does!
It carries over!

181
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,853
- I guess I just took that for granted.
- Okay...

182
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,554
do you not want to renew
our vows? Because...

183
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,188
No, I want to renew our vows until...
you know...

184
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,721
I didn't... can we take out
the eternity part?

185
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,132
No.

186
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,204
Okay.

187
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,677
It's nice
meeting you.

188
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,310
This is a treat.
This is really a treat.

189
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,515
- The treat is ours.
- Hi.

190
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,547
Look at you.
You look great.

191
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,388
- You happy?
- Yeah, I'm very happy.

192
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,223
Do I really need
to wear a suit for this?

193
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,491
Yes, look at everybody
who's dressed up.

194
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,498
So what have
we got going on?

195
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,625
Oh yeah, you should
say hello to the rabbi,

196
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,865
and, you know,
mix and mingle with people.

197
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,929
- Larry.
- Hello, Rabbi.

198
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,634
- Hello.
- Hello.

199
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,074
This is Colby.

200
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,634
Hi, Larry.
Nice to meet you.

201
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,981
- Where's this survivor?
- What?

202
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,848
He's the survivor.

203
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,917
From the... from
the television show.

204
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,416
- "Survivor."
- I was over in Australia.

205
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,519
- I'm a huge fan of "Seinfeld."
- He really is.

206
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,655
How is Jerry?

207
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,428
- He's good.
- Yeah?

208
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,094
Is he still
doing standup?

209
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,933
I just thought you two
should meet, you know,

210
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,566
- fellow celebrities, I thought...
- Uh-huh.

211
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,772
- Thanks again for having me over.
- No problem.

212
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,709
Okay, I'm gonna, uh,
say hello to my dad.

213
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,911
- Okay.
- Thanks again.

214
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,352
- Great sense of humor.
- He looked thrilled to meet you.

215
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,582
- Stunned.
- It was neat.

216
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,920
- Hi.
- Hey.

217
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,016
- You're the "Survivor" guy?
- Hello, Solly.

218
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,788
Hello. How are you?

219
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,194
- Good to see you.
- You too.

220
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,959
You have a
beautiful house.

221
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,263
Oh thank you.
Thank you.

222
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,828
- There's gonna be a dinner?
- Oh, there'll be a dinner.

223
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,736
A delicious dinner.

224
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,707
I like it,
I like it.

225
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:46,508
Hey, Solly, Cheryl and I are
renewing our vows on Saturday.

226
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,513
Why don't you come
keep my father company?

227
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,981
Oh, thank you,
thank you very much.

228
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,714
Listen, where is
the other survivor?

229
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,051
He's that, uh,
tall guy over there.

230
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,429
He's...

231
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,727
He's from
the television show.

232
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,895
"Survivor"?

233
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,697
Huh, what?

234
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,707
So here we are in a region
of Australia,

235
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,141
where out of the world's
10 most deadly snakes...

236
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,441
- Snakes.
- nine of them inhabit this region.

237
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,413
It was harrowing.

238
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,313
You come across
a taipan on the trail,

239
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,411
you get bit, you're dead...
30 minutes flat.

240
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,890
I'll tell you that's
a very interesting story.

241
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,916
Let me tell you, I was
in a concentration camp.

242
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,690
You never even suffered
one minute in your life

243
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,254
compared to what
I went through.

244
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,790
Look, I'm saying we spent 42 days
trying to survive.

245
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,065
We had very little rations,
no snacks.

246
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,800
Snacks? What are you
talking snacks?

247
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,535
We didn't eat,
sometimes for a week.

248
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,442
- For a month, we ate nothing!
- Don't.

249
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,809
- I went from...
- All right.

250
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,144
I couldn't even work out.
They didn't have a gym.

251
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,877
- A what?!
- I wore my sneakers out.

252
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,908
Next thing you know
I've got flip-flops.

253
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,183
- Flip-flops!
- We slept on the ground, on the dirt.

254
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,655
118° during the day,

255
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,749
98 at night
with 98% humidity.

256
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,660
- 45° below zero!
- Did you guys have a bathroom?

257
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,721
- A bathroom?!
- We didn't have one.

258
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,495
We had 12 people at a time
would go and shit...

259
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,594
- Well I'm sure you had toilet paper.
- We had newspaper.

260
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:23,165
- We had mosquitoes.
- Mosquito?! You see this glass eye?!

261
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,110
- Have you even seen the show?
- Did you ever see our show?

262
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,976
It was called
the Holocaust!

263
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,607
All I know is I was damned close
to that million dollars.

264
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,812
And the whole time, everyone's
backstabbing me and undermining me,

265
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,845
- trying to get me kicked off the show.
- Don't aggravate yourself.

266
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,187
You know nothing about survival!
I'm a survivor!

267
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,886
- I'm a survivor!
- I'm a survivor!

268
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,724
- I'm a survivor!
- I'm a surv...

269
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,633
Somebody get
a sponge.

270
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,461
I don't understand.
Why don't you get a sponge?

271
00:12:56,575 --> 00:13:00,067
What? I just told her
to get a sponge, that's all.

272
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,381
Are you getting dressed,
Larry?

273
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,282
The rabbi wants to start
the ceremony by noon.

274
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,185
My suit's not in the drycleaning.
I can't find it.

275
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,485
- What are you talking about?
- It's not there.

276
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,617
The guy gave me everything
that we had in there.

277
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,356
- She wasn't there?
- No, the husband was working.

278
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,489
Oh, okay.
No wonder why.

279
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,830
She doesn't give me
a ticket.

280
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,459
She doesn't
give you a ticket?

281
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,096
You know, she knows me.
I go in there a lot.

282
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,470
I go in there a lot.
She gives me a ticket.

283
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,676
Well then, just wear
your black suit, okay?

284
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,941
I got this new suit
just for this occasion.

285
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,380
You shouldn't have made me
wear it to the dinner party.

286
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,281
Oh my God.
I don't know what to tell you.

287
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,684
If they're closed,
they're closed.

288
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,780
You know what?
I always see their van on Ocampo.

289
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,883
I'll bet it's parked
in front of their house.

290
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,224
- Maybe they'll open the store for me.
- Mm-hmm.

291
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,094
- It's worth a shot.
- Okay, if that's what you're gonna do,

292
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,190
you need to go now,
all right?

293
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,326
And if not, I'll wear
the black one.

294
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,165
You'll wear
the black one.

295
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,144
Larry.

296
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,705
- What are you doing here?
- Well, um...

297
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,082
actually I, uh...

298
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,314
I kind of need
a bit of a favor.

299
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,982
I'm so sorry
for disturbing you.

300
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,651
You would never disturb me,
even if you tried.

301
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,628
That's very sweet
of you. Anyway...

302
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,823
How did you know
where I live, Larry?

303
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,426
I had seen your van
parked outside before.

304
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,130
You've been stalking me,
haven't you, Larry?

305
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,504
- No, not really. I saw the van there.
- Oh, Larry.

306
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,942
Anyway, I'm so sorry
to bother you on the Sabbath.

307
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,846
I was kind of wondering
if it would possible...

308
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:47,080
if there was any way
that you could go

309
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,111
open the store
so I can get my suit?

310
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:53,249
Well, you know it is the Sabbath.
I cannot drive.

311
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,021
Well, we can walk
over there.

312
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,324
It's... I can take you
piggyback.

313
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,355
Oh, now you're
talking, Larry.

314
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,266
You know,
Shlomo is at shul.

315
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,770
Oh.

316
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,034
Do you want to come in
for a drink?

317
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,337
Hmm?

318
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:16,338
Actually, I really don't
have that much time.

319
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,442
We're renewing
our vows, and...

320
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,749
I kind of got
to get going.

321
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,347
Your vows
with your wife.

322
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,618
Yes yes.

323
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,149
- 10 years?
- Yes yes, 10 years.

324
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,889
- Yeah yeah.
- I too have been married for 10 years.

325
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,261
Yeah.

326
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,960
10 long years.

327
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,036
I'll go get the keys.

328
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,648
- Hey.
- Hey.

329
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,954
What are you
doing here?

330
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,483
You should be
getting ready.

331
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,120
- I had to go pick up my suit...
- Oh.

332
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,222
from the drycleaners.
I had to go to her house.

333
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,665
- The Hasidim one?
- The one I was telling you about.

334
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,259
She invited me in
for a drink,

335
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,963
then we went
to the store...

336
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,903
- we set something up.
- You're kidding me!

337
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,876
I told her about the 10th
anniversary present.

338
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,572
One time. It's on.

339
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,773
Wow! Great!

340
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,646
- And guess what?
- What?

341
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,379
- I've got the rabbi's blessing.
- You talked to the rabbi?

342
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,410
I spoke to the rabbi.
I have his blessing.

343
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,982
- So you gotta go get a sheet now, huh?
- What are you talking about?

344
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,289
The Hassids, they have sex
through a sheet.

345
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,454
That's not...
come on, that's a myth.

346
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,964
Better show up with a sheet
or you'll be in big trouble.

347
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,523
- Really?
- Yes.

348
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,467
- Hey, Susie.
- You forgot the cantaloupes.

349
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,697
- Where are the cantaloupes?
- Forget the cantaloupe.

350
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,366
Come here for one second.
Come here, come here.

351
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,773
- How do the Hassids make love?
- What do you mean?

352
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,709
When Hasidim make love,
how do they do it?

353
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,872
- With the sheet you're talking about?
- Yeah.

354
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,507
They put in a hole in a sheet
and there's... through that.

355
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,676
- You're kidding.
- You didn't know that?

356
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,050
- I thought it was a myth.
- Everybody knows that.

357
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,453
It's not a myth. They cut a hole,
the man puts the penis in...

358
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,219
they can't touch
each other.

359
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,953
It's a religious thing
that they do.

360
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,858
What do you talk about,
how Hasidim have sex?

361
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:13,661
No, it just came...
the subject came up!

362
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,667
Help me with the bags,
all right?

363
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,259
- Wow.
- Yeah.

364
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,169
How do you like that?
I gotta get a sheet.

365
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,072
Know what you should do?
You should spring for a satin sheet.

366
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,042
Really? I don't think
that would be good.

367
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,476
You'd be sliding
all over.

368
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,377
- Well.
- Cut it beforehand, you think?

369
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,474
Beforehand! Show up with the hole
beforehand. You gotta do that.

370
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,144
I would think
it might be kind of fun

371
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,380
cutting the hole with her,
sharing it, you know?

372
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,252
Jeff, will you bring
in the groceries?!

373
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,984
- I'm coming!
- I'll see you later.

374
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,151
All right, bye.

375
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,891
Larry?

376
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,230
Look, aren't you
glad I picked it up?

377
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,236
My mother is very
upset right now,

378
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,568
and she says she's not
coming to the ceremony.

379
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,597
- What? Why?
- Because of your sponge comment.

380
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,780
- You want me to go talk to her?
- Yes, I do!

381
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,612
She was just trying
to help out.

382
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,778
Then she should've got the sponge.
Why does she want somebody else

383
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,253
- to get the sponge?
- Oh my God.

384
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,415
If she's trying to help,
then get the sponge.

385
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,126
Mom.

386
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,890
Mom, I just want
to apologize about the...

387
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,928
you know, the whole
"sponge" thing.

388
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,638
What happened
that night...

389
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:33,202
because of the whole...
the survivor confrontation...

390
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:37,579
it just brought up a lot of stuff
about the Holocaust,

391
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:41,211
and it's kind of in my DNA
and I was very flummoxed by it.

392
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,050
Very flummoxed.

393
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:47,081
You wouldn't understand,
but if you were in my religion,

394
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:51,358
what happened to my people... things came
out that shouldn't have been said.

395
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:54,957
and I certainly
apologize for that.

396
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,095
- Thank you.
- And...

397
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,131
even though, you know,
you were kind of...

398
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,109
right by the kitchen...

399
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,271
you were the closest one
there, I thought.

400
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,577
- You don't respect me.
- Oh, that's not true.

401
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,585
- I don't think you like me.
- I like everybody.

402
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,453
- I have...
- I'm a people person, I like everybody.

403
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,424
I love people.
You know what?

404
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,427
Let's just put this
behind us, come on.

405
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,396
- Come on.
- What is this?

406
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,057
Let's go, let's go!

407
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,828
Let's go.
Let's go to ceremony.

408
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,529
Come on, this is crazy.
It's so silly, come on.

409
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,403
A sponge.
Yes, come on.

410
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,373
Next time you're
by the kitchen...

411
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,774
- Oh, get out! I'll get my dress.
...you'll get a sponge.

412
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,710
You're standing two feet
from the kitchen.

413
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,941
You get the sponge
next time, so what?

414
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,853
- Oh my gosh.
- All present and accounted for.

415
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:54,086
I've never seen
such a car in my life.

416
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,458
It's a beautiful car.

417
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,690
My beautiful
Cheryl,

418
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,459
Larry,

419
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,160
congratulations.

420
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,466
Thank you.
Thanks, everybody.

421
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,301
It's so nice
to be here.

422
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,239
What a pleasure
this is here.

423
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,071
Glad you're here,
Solly.

424
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,577
Listen, wait till you see
these two getting married.

425
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,240
You've got
a big affair yet.

426
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,912
What is he doing?

427
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,754
He's mimicking me.

428
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,555
Why are you
mimicking me?

429
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,528
No no no, the light
from your glass eye,

430
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,029
it's reflecting
on me.

431
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,895
You-you were
making fun of me!

432
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,492
- No no no!
- I don't like this here!

433
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,628
I don't want to be here!
No more!

434
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,104
Hold it,
stop the car!

435
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,300
No, Solly.
Wait, Solly.

436
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,776
Please,
don't get out.

437
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,712
Somebody get a sponge.

438
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,684
Right, so then I'll
do the blessing...

439
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,194
the last blessing.

440
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,093
Just a little bit
of Hebrew,

441
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,826
and then I will put
the glass on the floor

442
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,097
and you'll step on it
and that'll be it.

443
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,366
That's when everybody
yells a "matza toff"?

444
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,498
No no, it's mazel tov.
It means good luck.

445
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,270
- Could we say yippee or something?
- Or good luck?

446
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,302
- Hallelujah would be good.
- Can you just say mazel tov?

447
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,406
- Anything else?
- Um, just that the Hebrew,

448
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,940
I mean, are we gonna
know what you're saying?

449
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,816
I'll translate it.
It's very basic.

450
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,288
Want me to translate?
"We love God. Thank you, God.

451
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,190
Thanks, God. God, you're great.
Oh, God, you're wonderful.

452
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,921
You're amazing, God.
It's all God."

453
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,758
It's a little
overdone, but...

454
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,630
Well, it's a blessing.
It's more about you than God.

455
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,601
Larry, I'm sorry.

456
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,694
You know, I don't want
to change the subject,

457
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,604
but isn't there something
you can do about that stain?

458
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,473
I mean,
it's horrifying.

459
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,740
Yeah, I know.
It's a...

460
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,940
it's a go-home stain,
but I didn't go home.

461
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,541
I mean, I just...
it's kind of disrespectful.

462
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,986
Just in terms of
standing in front of the ark and...

463
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,683
- Mm-hm.
- Excuse me, does anybody have a mint?

464
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,692
I got a mint.

465
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,886
It's in my pocket.

466
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,758
Do you want me
to hand it to you?

467
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,423
It's loose.
It's not in a package.

468
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,365
Or do you want to put your hand
in my pocket and get it yourself?

469
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,958
You got three options.
You can do

470
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,027
one of those two things
or you can refuse it.

471
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:22,006
- There you go.
- Cheryl, honey, would you...

472
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,634
Reach into Larry's pocket
for an unwrapped mint? Sure.

473
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,270
- This is fine. Here.
- Thank you, darling. Great.

474
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,280
A loose mint.
You got your mint. Great.

475
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,872
- Okay?
- Everybody ready?

476
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,213
- Yeah.
- Let's roll.

477
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,549
What?
"Let's roll"?

478
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,248
What did you say?

479
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,722
What?

480
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,455
You knew that my brother-in-law
died on September 11th.

481
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,292
How dare you say
something like that!

482
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,891
With all due respect,
wasn't that just a coincidence?

483
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,164
- Poor choice of words.
- What the hell kind of a...

484
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,603
- All right...
- Oh, you know, I don't want to do this!

485
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,539
Forget it, forget it!

486
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,236
I didn't know,
that if you...

487
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,642
- Larry.
- that if you died uptown on 9-11

488
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,204
that it was part of it...
of the tragedy, l...

489
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,376
Do I have to listen to this? Do I have to go
on and on and on about this?

490
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,182
I didn't know that an uptown death
on West 57th Street

491
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,655
was part of
the tragedy.

492
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,385
I-I don't think
I want to do this.

493
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,757
I-I really don't. You look like a slob.

494
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,194
- I don't think you're serious.
- What? No.

495
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,358
- You could've gone home with...
- Rabbi, you're going very far.

496
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,459
We came all the way
from Florida for this,

497
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,902
and we like to get it
over with if you don't mind.

498
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,497
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- He really doesn't.

499
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,440
What do they say
in the Bible?

500
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,706
- "He knows not whereof"...
- Don't try to quote the Bible.

501
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,303
Just don't...
don't try.

502
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,042
- Let's quit.
- Cheryl, I'll do it.

503
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,312
- Rabbi, thank you.
- I'll do it for you.

504
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,751
- I really appreciate it.
- "He knows not whereof..."

505
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,550
I'm sorry about
your loss.

506
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,523
- Larry, you be quiet.
- Thank you, thank you. Come on.

507
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,549
All right, let's vamoose.
Let's vamoose!

508
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,582
Okay.

509
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,789
And may we continue
to love each other unconditionally,

510
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,063
not only throughout
this lifetime,

511
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,570
but after death
through all eternity.

512
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,776
- That's very moving, Cheryl.
- Thank you.

513
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,744
Okay, Larry.

514
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,114
Uh...

515
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,716
I'm drawing
a blank here, Rabbi.

516
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,396
I don't have
the paper.

517
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:30,265
You know what?
Just speak from your heart.

518
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,964
Just speak to Cheryl,
look into her eyes,

519
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,063
and it'll come...
the words will come.

520
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,840
Things have been good.

521
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,048
It's a very good...

522
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,209
relationship...
10 years.

523
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,014
It's pretty good.

524
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,988
It's pretty pretty...

525
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,684
pretty pretty good.

526
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,489
And...

527
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:00,225
I am your
devoted servant...

528
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,257
well I don't know
about servant, but...

529
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:06,395
I'm not a servant,
but I'll certainly help you

530
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:09,703
if you ever need help
with anything, you know that.

531
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,175
I'm in the house a lot.

532
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,542
You want to open a bridge table?
Whatever you need.

533
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,071
I'm not a great handyman,
and I'm not good at making plans.

534
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,050
That I don't do very well
I have to admit.

535
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,053
She makes the plans.

536
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,351
She makes good plans.
We always have stuff to do.

537
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:32,024
And I will love you
for the rest of my life.

538
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,857
Until the day I die.

539
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,734
I'll love you
until death.

540
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,466
That's a pretty
good thing.

541
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,838
Not that many women
have that.

542
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,173
Right now
till the day I die,

543
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,736
there will never be
any other woman till death.

544
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,873
And we don't,
you know...

545
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,747
after death who knows
what happens?

546
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,649
- Even you... you don't know.
- No.

547
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:58,554
I promise to love you
through all eternity.

548
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,026
All right, eternity.

549
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,658
Okay, okay.
Uh...

550
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,793
before I pronounce you
man and wife,

551
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,803
it's time
to break the glass.

552
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,238
Here we go. I'm just gonna...

553
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,835
Oh God, my hand!

554
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,972
Oh, it's bleeding!
Jesus!

555
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,421
Somebody get
a sponge.

556
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,103
Hey.

557
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,663
It's about
fucking time, Larry.

558
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,835
My God, I've been waiting all day.
Come on in.

559
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,242
- What is that?
- My suit.

560
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,803
I got it stained
at the ceremony.

561
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,543
I figured as long as I'm here,
I'd drop it off with you.

562
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,313
- Drop it off with me?
- Yeah.

563
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,516
- Here?
- I figured you'd save me a trip.

564
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,387
Why didn't you take it
to the cleaners?

565
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,688
Well, I'm here.
You're a cleaner.

566
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:12,925
I'm not going to schlep your dirty clothes
all the way there. Why should I?

567
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,761
What's the big deal?
Put it in your trunk.

568
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,131
- You're going over there.
- Throw it in your trunk.

569
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,726
You take it
in your fucking car,

570
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,170
and you go over to the cleaners.
Not a big deal. You do it all the time.

571
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,437
I figured I'd kill two birds
with one stone.

572
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,876
I am not going to schlep
your dirty fucking clothes

573
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,539
over to the cleaners, Larry.
My God!

574
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,073
- How do you deal with wine stains?
- We get them out.

575
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,110
- What about blood?
- Of course. We get everything.

576
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,554
We're very good... we're
the best cleaners around.

577
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,490
- Wine and blood?
- Wine and blood!

578
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,289
You got your work cut out
for you with this one.

579
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,161
- What is wrong with you?
- Don't get so riled up about it.

580
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,995
- I'm not so riled up.
- You're going to the store anyway.

581
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,231
You come here to fuck or you come here to
talk about your dirty suit?

582
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,259
Hmm?

583
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,568
Fuck or suit?

584
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,441
- Okay, the first one.
- Well there you go.

585
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,106
Let's go.
I don't got all day.

586
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,015
- So you're not gonna take the suit?
- Jesus Christ!

587
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,348
All right.

588
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,692
- Where'd you get the sheet?
- Linen store.

589
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,162
Who brings a sheet
to a hotel?

590
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,188
And what's it...
there's a hole there.

591
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,935
Yeah...
'cause your Hasidic.

592
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,939
What, do you believe
that stupid shit?

593
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,941
What kind of fucking
idiot are you?

594
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,499
Oh my God.

595
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,603
Oh shit!
It's an earthquake!

596
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,943
Wait, Larry!

597
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,073
Oh, Jeez!

598
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,151
Larry!

599
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,653
Hey, we survived.
