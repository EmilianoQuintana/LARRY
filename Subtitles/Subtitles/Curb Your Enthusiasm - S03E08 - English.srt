1
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:29,299
- Whoo.
- Not bad, huh?

2
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:32,005
That's not bad
at all.

3
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:34,673
- That's official, know what I mean?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:36,512
- Did you pick that out?
- Yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,847
I got a matching earring
too, right there.

6
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:40,318
That's nice, right?

7
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:42,015
That says "true love"
right there.

8
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:44,046
Now, I ain't
into rapping too much,

9
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,889
but when it pays
for rocks like these, you got it.

10
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:50,055
You don't mind your daughter
marrying a rap star?

11
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:52,190
Oh, no, not at all.

12
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,640
Excuse me
for one second.

13
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:05,008
Larry? Larry?

14
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:07,775
Larry!

15
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:09,782
Oh.

16
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:12,182
What are
you doing?

17
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:14,847
Stepping on some
packing bubbles.

18
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:16,788
I know, but why
are you doing that?

19
00:01:16,823 --> 00:01:19,553
Because it makes
a fun kind of popping noise.

20
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:22,687
It's fun.

21
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,197
I know,
we can hear you, that's why...

22
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:28,929
Why aren't you
mixing in with people? Mingling?

23
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:31,597
You know what?
I'm gonna get going, I think.

24
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:34,004
I got to pick up a script
at Jeff's house.

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,873
Jeff's house?
I thought he was staying in a hotel.

26
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,174
No, they bought
a new house.

27
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:40,804
It's right in the neighborhood.
They just moved in.

28
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:44,806
Oh! That was fast.
What about the dog? What happened?

29
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,285
He's getting
allergy shots now...

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,412
- And everything's fine?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:50,946
- Wow, all right.
- So, I'm gonna go over there.

32
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:54,154
Just stay for 10
more minutes, okay?

33
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:55,422
All right, fine.

34
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:58,727
I'm gonna run to the restroom,
I'll meet you back.

35
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:04,667
- What's crackin', player?
- How are you?

36
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:07,104
I'm all right,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,543
- I'm chilling, what's up?
- Chilling. Just chilling.

38
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:13,307
- You a writer, right?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:15,314
I wrote some shit
this morning.

40
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:17,509
I write my own lyrics and shit,
you know what I mean?

41
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,576
- Yeah.
- You want to help me out with it?

42
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:21,450
- I've never written rap...
- That's all right.

43
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:23,353
- I want to see what you got.
- Okay, go ahead.

44
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,824
Check this shit out.
It's called "I'm Coming to Get You."

45
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:27,622
"I'm Coming
to Get You," okay.

46
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:30,391
"So you think you're gonna cross me
and mess with my shit,

47
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,126
Opening your fucking trap
and flapping your lip?

48
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,464
Don't fuck with me, nigga,
or you're gonna get dropped,

49
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:38,471
I'll snap off your neck with
a crackle and pop."

50
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:40,632
Oh, I like the
Rice Krispies thing, yeah.

51
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:42,938
- You got that shit?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:45,035
- "Crackle and pop," of course.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:47,046
"If you say anything,
you'll beg me to die,

54
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,241
'Cause I'll make you
suck my dick, then I'll nut in your eye.

55
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:51,750
I'll stomp on your world
as if my name was Godzilla,

56
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:53,514
I'm coming for you,
motherfucker,

57
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:55,612
I'm your Krazee-Eyez Killa."
You know?

58
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:56,917
And I'm going
to be like this in the video,

59
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:59,653
like... you know
what I mean?

60
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:02,355
I like it.

61
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:05,057
I got one tiny
little comment.

62
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:06,861
What, what, what?

63
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:11,003
I would lose the "motherfucker"
at the end,

64
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:14,200
'cause you already said "fuck" once,
you don't need two fucks.

65
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:16,004
You already
got the one fuck.

66
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:17,839
I would change
the "motherfucker" to "bitch."

67
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,870
- Because the bitch...
- "I'm coming for you, bitch..."

68
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:22,779
Yes, because "bitch"
is a word that you would use

69
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:26,650
to somebody who you
disrespect, right?

70
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:28,278
Doesn't that
sound...

71
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:30,687
- You my dawg. You my nigga.
- I am your nigga. Absolutely.

72
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:32,885
Yeah, that's right,
player, that's right.

73
00:03:32,926 --> 00:03:34,894
I like that shit.
Yeah, I like you, motherfucker.

74
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:37,795
Don't hit me.
Yeah, yeah. Check it out.

75
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,129
You like
eating pussy?

76
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:44,099
You know, it's...

77
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,799
I'm a little...
I like it, I like it,

78
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,900
but I'm a little
too lazy to do it, you know?

79
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:52,104
It's a whole to-do, you know?
It hurts my neck.

80
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,739
- Yeah, I'm too lazy.
- You're too lazy to eat pussy?

81
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:57,272
It hurts my neck.
I get too lazy to do that.

82
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:59,376
Oh, man, you got
to eat the pussy, the cooch.

83
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:01,512
Oh shit, yeah. You know what
the best pussy is to eat?

84
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:03,182
Asian pussy.

85
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:05,555
Krazee-Eyez Killa,
you're getting married.

86
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:07,992
Wanda's, you know,
you can't do that anymore.

87
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:10,496
No, I have to do that,
motherfucker.

88
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,623
You know what I'm saying?
I have to eat the pussy.

89
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,429
- Really?
- I can't live without that shit.

90
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,560
- You have to eat the pussy?
- Have to have different flavor pussy.

91
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:19,766
You got Wanda now.
You can't do it. Wanda's gonna find out.

92
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:21,740
Wanda ain't gonna
find out shit.

93
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,970
You my nigga, right?
This is between me and you.

94
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,308
- Well, yes, I'm your nigger.
- How is she gonna find out?

95
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,177
She ain't she gonna
find out, is she?

96
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:31,377
- Not from me. Absolutely not.
- Right. She ain't gonna find out.

97
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:33,852
- She's not gonna find out.
- Right, right, right.

98
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:37,653
All right, Krazee-Eyez Killa,
I got to take off.

99
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:39,454
I got to pick up a script
at my friend's house.

100
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:42,552
All right, nice to see you.
Give me some.

101
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:45,224
Yeah, yeah.

102
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,932
- Hello.
- Hey.

103
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:59,241
- Welcome, welcome.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.

104
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,507
Good to be in
the neighborhood.

105
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:02,742
Look at this.

106
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:05,751
I just go where the wife
tells me to go.

107
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:08,276
Yeah, well, don't we all?
Look at this place.

108
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:12,189
- Amazing.
- Hold on. I got the script for you.

109
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:14,386
Read it, tell me what you think
and we'll see what happens.

110
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:17,225
- Hey, Lar? Huh?
- Hey, hey, yeah.

111
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:19,663
- Is this something?
- Yeah, congratulations.

112
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,496
- Thank you.
- That's wonderful.

113
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:23,627
- We're so happy here, aren't we, honey?
- We sure are.

114
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,297
So come on,
I'll give you the tour.

115
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:27,306
You know what?
that's okay.

116
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,035
- I get it.
- What do you mean?

117
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:32,203
You know, it's bedrooms,
bathrooms... I get it.

118
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:34,338
I see it, it's beautiful,
it's great.

119
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:36,372
You don't
want a tour?

120
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,906
You don't need
to walk me around...

121
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:42,251
Get the fuck out of my house, okay?
Get the fuck out right now!

122
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:44,552
All right, fine,
I'll take the house tour.

123
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:46,252
No, no, I'm done,
I'm over it.

124
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:48,351
I'm turned off.
Leave!

125
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:52,126
Get the fuck out,
okay?

126
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,726
Freak of fucking nature,
doesn't want a house tour.

127
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,464
Susie, I'll take
the house tour.

128
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:59,768
No, no!
No tour for you.

129
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:02,797
We'll have lunch
tomorrow, don't forget.

130
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:04,673
Okay, lunch
tomorrow.

131
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:15,548
- Larry? Hey.
- Oh, hey.

132
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:17,681
Well, what'd you think
of that party?

133
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:21,125
That was fun,
wasn't it?

134
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:23,186
Fun? I don't know.
Was it fun?

135
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:27,757
It was very fun.
Did you get to talk to Krazee-Eyez?

136
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,496
Yeah, we had a nice
little conversation.

137
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,470
He's something else,
isn't he?

138
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:34,064
Quite a character.
Loves the ladies.

139
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:36,098
- To say the least.
- To say the least.

140
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:39,805
Yeah, he really
gets around.

141
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:42,280
- Oh, yeah, you know?
- Yeah.

142
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:43,646
I mean,
everybody knows.

143
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:46,743
Everybody knows?

144
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:49,414
You're kidding.

145
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:51,686
- Wanda knows?
- Yeah.

146
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,019
That's not how
he presented it to me.

147
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:58,394
Well, what
do you mean?

148
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:02,401
What do you mean?

149
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,926
What do you mean?
I mean, everybody knows

150
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:08,532
that he likes to flirt
with the women.

151
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:10,270
Why?
What was he telling you?

152
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,778
No, that... you know,
he likes to...

153
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:15,303
What did he
tell you?

154
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:18,813
Was he telling you
about women?

155
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:20,683
- Come on, Cheryl. What?
- Oh my God.

156
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,245
Is he fooling
around on Wanda?

157
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,814
All right...
oh my God.

158
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:27,793
I don't know
what he's doing, okay?

159
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:30,591
Oh my God.

160
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,632
You know,
this doesn't surprise me, I'm...

161
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,634
- What?
- I'm gonna call her...

162
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,363
You're gonna what?

163
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:39,530
He told you he's fooling around
with other women.

164
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:42,234
But you're not gonna call
Wanda now?

165
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,675
Of course I am.
She's engaged to him.

166
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:47,009
I don't care.
He'll blame me. You can't do that.

167
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:49,947
You know what he's gonna do?
Have you heard his lyrics?

168
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:53,475
Huh?
"If you betray me, you're gonna die"?

169
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,683
"You'll suck on my dick,
I'll put a nut in your eye"?

170
00:07:56,723 --> 00:08:00,124
That's a nice scenario for me.
So, do me a favor...

171
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,560
That's a song.
This is real life, okay?

172
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:05,393
- Yeah, I understand.
- This is Wanda's real life.

173
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:07,126
I understand.
You want to tell her, go ahead.

174
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,828
I'm gonna tell you
something, okay?

175
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:11,564
- You say one word to her...
- Larry, she's my best friend.

176
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:13,697
I will be
in Antarctica.

177
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,607
That's how far away
I will be from Southern California.

178
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:18,634
You're that scared
of Krazee-Eyez

179
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:21,909
that you'd flee
the country?

180
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:23,779
Yeah, I am,
yes, I am!

181
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:27,253
I want to live,
I want to have both legs.

182
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,084
I want to have my penis,
all right,

183
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:31,818
and my testicles
intact.

184
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:33,587
This is her life, okay?

185
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:36,390
She's starting a whole
new life with this guy...

186
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,192
This is my life
and I'd like to live it

187
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:40,927
by not going into
handicapped parking.

188
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,199
Hey, tomorrow,
the reshoot

189
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,935
for the Scorsese
movie.

190
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:51,409
You're all hip to it?
You're good?

191
00:08:51,444 --> 00:08:53,139
- Yeah.
- Okay.

192
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:56,512
The wardrobe people
wanted you to bring the jacket.

193
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:59,416
The cream-colored jacket
with blue stitching.

194
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:01,317
She left a message
on the machine, I got it.

195
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,822
All right, good. I don't want to make
a big deal about this.

196
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:06,849
- I'm gonna mention it, and that's it.
- What did I do now?

197
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:10,124
It wouldn't have killed you to have
taken the house tour.

198
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:14,224
I feel very queer
taking house tours.

199
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,758
Queer?
My wife shows you the house...

200
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:19,067
I gotta go,
"Oh, that's nice"...

201
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:21,198
- Did you have to go somewhere?
- No.

202
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:22,970
All right,
you know what?

203
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:26,501
"Hey, look at that closet!
Nice beams up there.

204
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:30,038
I like those beams.
What's the name of that architect?"

205
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:36,755
Good coffee.

206
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:39,383
It is good coffee.

207
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:41,188
Pretend this is
a commercial.

208
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,218
Watch me do this
as a commercial, okay?

209
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:47,759
Boy, that's really
good coffee.

210
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:57,538
Cheryl!

211
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:59,977
What?

212
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,214
What?
God damn it!

213
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,549
What is up
with the bubbles?!

214
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:10,317
Take it easy.
What are you screaming about?

215
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,620
I'm tired of listening to these
things pop all over.

216
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:15,560
I just found these.

217
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:18,758
I'll pop 'em today
and be done with it.

218
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:22,097
What's...
what's wrong?

219
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:25,696
Where's that cream-colored jacket
with the blue stitching?

220
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:27,672
Oh...

221
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:30,198
the really ugly one
with the hole in it?

222
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:33,110
- Yeah, the one from the movie.
- I threw it away.

223
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:35,376
You threw it away?
What do you mean you threw it away?

224
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:37,849
You're weren't gonna wear it.
It had a hole in it. It's hideous.

225
00:10:37,884 --> 00:10:40,944
Of course it had a hole in it,
that's where I got shot.

226
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:45,120
I need it
for the reshoot.

227
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:47,251
I didn't know
you were gonna need it.

228
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,454
Do you know
what this means?

229
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:51,360
All kinds of problems
this is causing

230
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:53,126
because there's
a reshoot now,

231
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,191
and this jacket's been established
in other scenes...

232
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:57,930
I think it was from Mitchell's.
I saw the tag,

233
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,906
- "Mitchell's on Melrose."
- Mitchell's on Melrose.

234
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,636
Okay.
That's not working.

235
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:11,147
- This really works.
- Yeah, well, it looks great.

236
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:13,015
I can't believe
you still had this thing.

237
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:15,077
Actually, that's
the last one we've got.

238
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:17,316
Oh, man, you are
saving me.

239
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:21,088
I desperately needed this
to do this reshoot on this movie.

240
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:23,595
Well, great, you're in luck.
Here, I'll take it.

241
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:25,062
If you want to look
at some other stuff,

242
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:26,929
we'll get that
ready for you over here.

243
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:28,729
Okay, I kind of like
this thing.

244
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:30,668
I like...
what is this?

245
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:32,500
Oh, this is
an extra large.

246
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,506
Let me see,
it might not fit.

247
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,373
- It's a great sweater too.
- Nah, way too big.

248
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,378
Is that it?
You don't have any more?

249
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:41,710
It only comes
in that size, I'm sorry.

250
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,909
I'll tell you what,
I'll fold that up for you

251
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,009
- and we can get you rung up over there.
- That's okay, I got it.

252
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:47,917
- I can take care of it.
- No, no problem.

253
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:49,751
Actually, I kind of need
to take care of it.

254
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:52,952
We have a very
specific way that we fold things

255
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:55,460
so I'll take care
of it, okay?

256
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:57,326
It's not that complicated.
I can do it.

257
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:59,092
It's not that
complicated?

258
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:00,827
Actually, it is a little
complicated.

259
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,198
- This is complicated?
- Yeah, it's a little complicated.

260
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,203
There's a specific
way we need to...

261
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:05,636
can you let go...?
Okay, thank you.

262
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:07,605
You're stretching
it out now.

263
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,268
It's not a scoop neck,
it's actually a v-neck. Thank you.

264
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:11,867
I've got it.

265
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:14,505
All right, well,
I'm sorry for trying to help you out.

266
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:16,037
Well, you weren't
helping me out.

267
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:18,346
You're actually stretching out...
you're damaging merchandise.

268
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:20,648
- Boy, you really got it down.
- Yeah, I did get it down, okay?

269
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:22,950
I never could have done that.
That's so hard to do.

270
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:24,650
Actually, I'm gonna
ask you to leave.

271
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,282
I don't need to be insulted
in my own store.

272
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:27,849
I'm gonna ask you
to leave, okay?

273
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:30,055
All right, I'll just take
the jacket and...

274
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:31,893
I don't think you're
going to take the jacket.

275
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,695
Have a nice day. I don't like
to be insulted in my own store.

276
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:37,931
Hey, you insulted me, I didn't insult
you. I was trying to help you.

277
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,167
How many people
come in here and fold a sweater?

278
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:43,675
- No one does, actually.
- No one's considerate enough to do it.

279
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,574
I'm considerate
enough to do it.

280
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:48,273
It's not an issue of consideration.
Actually, you're insulting me,

281
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:49,679
that's why you're not
getting the jacket.

282
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:51,182
I wasn't insulting you,
I was trying to help you.

283
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:54,550
Trying to help me by making
extra work for me. Thanks a lot.

284
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:56,179
Come on, I'll just give you
the credit card.

285
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:58,520
You're not gonna
buy the jacket.

286
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:00,753
- Don't sell it until I say so.
- Don't be an asshole.

287
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:02,727
I'm not being an asshole.
You're being an asshole,

288
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:05,128
that's why I'd like you to leave,
okay? Thank you.

289
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:07,155
Thanks a lot,
have a good day.

290
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,497
And by the way,
don't try to send

291
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:10,024
any friends in here
to buy the jacket,

292
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:11,661
'cause I'm not
selling it to anyone.

293
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:14,036
You think I'd send anybody
to this piece of shit store?

294
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,425
There is something
I have to tell you.

295
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:37,759
Krazee-Eyez is
cheating on you.

296
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:40,288
What?!
How do you know?

297
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,392
Larry told me.

298
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:46,064
That cheating son of a bitch,
I'm gonna kick his ass.

299
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:47,834
Are you gonna tell him
that Larry told you?

300
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:50,809
You goddamn
right I am.

301
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,314
Yeah, I think it's Knox Road
and Silver Lake.

302
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:00,247
Um, "Killer."

303
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:02,015
Yeah, that's
the last name.

304
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:04,750
"Krazee-Eyez."

305
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,382
There might be
a hyphen in that.

306
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:09,917
Well, "Krazee," I guess
is the first name,

307
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:13,125
unless the whole last name
is "Krazee-Eyez Killer."

308
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:17,330
K-R-A-Z... Y,
"Krazy-Eyez."

309
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,338
What about an "H"
at the end of "Killa"?

310
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:21,465
Did you try that?
"K-l-L-L-A-H"?

311
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,634
What about the "Z"?

312
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:26,304
"Eyez"? E-Y-E-Z?
Is that possible?

313
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:28,540
No, no, that's
an optometry place.

314
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:32,244
Okay, all right,
thank you.

315
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:01,536
- What the fuck you doing?
- Hey.

316
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:04,379
Where's my nigga?
Where's my nigga?

317
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:06,647
There's my motherfucking nigga
right there.

318
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,278
Get your ass in here.
All right.

319
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:10,915
Larry-fucking-David!
God damn!

320
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:13,187
You came to see
my motherfucking shit, didn't you?

321
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:16,218
Krazee-Eyez...

322
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:18,492
I'm supposed to meet
Cheryl and Wanda.

323
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:20,692
Do you have any idea
where they went?

324
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,429
Fuck... I think D said something
about "tea bags"?

325
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:28,031
- Is that right?
- Yeah... thanks, Krazee.

326
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:30,599
Hey, hey, what's up man?
Where you going?

327
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:32,907
You just
got here, nigga.

328
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:35,004
Don't you want
a tour of the house?

329
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:37,675
You want a tour
of the house, don't you?

330
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:41,016
You want a tour?
Come on motherfucker, come on!

331
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:43,681
Yeah, that's right. Come on, yeah,
Larry-fucking-David.

332
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:46,851
Okay, yeah. See this shit,
this is the dining room, you know?

333
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:50,157
- This is where you eat.
- Yeah, we do our dining here and shit.

334
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:52,892
We got some... got a table,
a dining room table.

335
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:55,332
You got some
chairs and shit.

336
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:56,926
You know what I mean?
We got us some lamps and shit.

337
00:15:56,969 --> 00:15:59,301
We got the floor,
you know what I mean?

338
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:00,965
It's made out of...

339
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:03,475
some floor shit,
you know what I'm saying?

340
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:05,841
- Yeah, it's floor shit.
- We got some steps right here.

341
00:16:05,878 --> 00:16:07,709
Got four of these
motherfuckers.

342
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:09,681
I wanted three,
but I was like, four is better.

343
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:12,684
- Four steps, uh-huh.
- We got a door here and a door there.

344
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:15,516
We got rooms all over this motherfucker.
You know what I mean?

345
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,681
Yo, check it.
You like this shit?

346
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:19,850
The Oriental room
and shit?

347
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:21,951
All the shit
go down right there.

348
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:24,360
The bed's a lot smaller
than I would have thought.

349
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,092
Maybe I will get
a bigger bed.

350
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:27,963
I can have three or four
motherfuckers in there.

351
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,831
Know what I'm saying?
A whole harem of motherfuckers.

352
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:31,598
You got to have three or four
motherfuckers in there.

353
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,502
- You a motherfucking pimp, ain't you?
- I don't think I am.

354
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:36,337
You are a pimp.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

355
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,637
You know, I want...

356
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:39,838
You got a garbage can?
I gotta...

357
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,437
No, you can throw
that shit anywhere.

358
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,243
I got someone to clean up after.
Go ahead, throw it.

359
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:45,341
- Toss it.
- Okay.

360
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:47,409
Toss
the motherfucker.

361
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:49,478
See?
There you go.

362
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:51,615
Watch this shit.
Yo, Delicious!

363
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:53,522
Delicious!

364
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,288
Tell Matilda to come in here
and clean this shit up.

365
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:57,592
And bring me an Alizé.
Do you want something, brother?

366
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,657
No, thank you.
I actually kind of got to...

367
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:04,602
What's up?
You like some shit?

368
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:09,541
What?

369
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:12,066
I have the exact
same jacket.

370
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:14,341
But I mean,
I lost it, but l...

371
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,848
you don't understand. I'm supposed
to wear this in this movie tomorrow.

372
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:18,713
Hey, it's cool, man.
You all excited and shit.

373
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:21,584
You want to try it on?
Go try it on, I don't give a shit.

374
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,885
No, but this is unbelievable
because I lost the jacket.

375
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:27,984
Try the fucking
jacket on, man.

376
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:29,892
Holy shit, I can't
even believe this.

377
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:32,489
I'm thinking about putting a plasma
screen on the fucking ceiling

378
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:37,332
and have "Scarface"
like, 24-7. Let me see.

379
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:41,506
- Oh, you official.
- This is amazing.

380
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,599
- This is amazing.
- I like that shit. You like it?

381
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:44,870
- All right.
- It's yours.

382
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,878
- Get out of here.
- Fuck it.

383
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:49,142
Fuck it, I don't need it.
I got plenty of shit right here.

384
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:51,513
Krazee-Eyez, I don't know what to say.
This is unbelievable.

385
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,040
You don't have to say shit.
We roll like that, you know what I mean?

386
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:55,576
- Are you my Caucasian?
- I'm your... man...!

387
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,885
- Are you my Caucasian?
- I'm your fucking Caucasian.

388
00:17:57,923 --> 00:17:59,857
- All right.
- All right, all right.

389
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,450
You know what?
Honest to God.

390
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:04,156
I love the crib,
it's fantastic.

391
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:06,994
You know what?
My wife's gonna kick my ass.

392
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:09,227
- I got to get out of here.
- Oh, shit, you got to go?

393
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:11,498
- Yeah, I got to go.
- Oh, man, I know how that shit is.

394
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:14,301
I know how that shit is.
Don't let her fuck with you.

395
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,501
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm gonna sneeze, but thank you.

396
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,339
Yo, Delicious!
Get a tissue, my man's gonna sneeze.

397
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:20,208
Delicious!

398
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:39,556
There's no discussion...

399
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:42,499
Hey.

400
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,503
Hi, Barbara.

401
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:46,869
What are you
doing here?

402
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:49,704
Just came
to see you, you know.

403
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:50,970
- Why?
- Hi Wanda.

404
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,978
Hey, Larry.

405
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:56,539
I just didn't like
the way things ended with us earlier...

406
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:58,379
How did you know
we were here?

407
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:02,615
I went to Krazee-Eyez
and he told me.

408
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:05,123
You went to that
son of a bitch's house?

409
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:07,785
Do you know
he's cheating on me?

410
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:10,159
That no-good
cock-eyed bastard.

411
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:13,563
Cheating. I know.
He's fucking around, Larry.

412
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,067
My husband is dead
and I wouldn't fuck around.

413
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:19,593
Did you interrupt those bunch of sluts
up there and everything?

414
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:21,572
A big fuckfest
going on, Larry?

415
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:24,405
No, no fuckfest.
Just Delicious, that's all.

416
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:27,345
He's cheating
on me, Larry.

417
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:30,405
Have you told him yet
that you know?

418
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:34,408
No, but I'm going to. I'm gonna tell him
that and a few other things.

419
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:37,013
When he asks you how you know,
what are you gonna say?

420
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:38,921
I'm gonna
tell him I heard.

421
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,926
Heard from who?

422
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,588
I heard from
somebody, I just...

423
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:46,621
"Somebody"? Don't you think you
should be a little specific?

424
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:48,929
What difference does it make?
Why do you give a shit?

425
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:51,300
I think you need
to tell him who you heard it from,

426
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:53,305
otherwise he could think
the wrong person told you,

427
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:56,274
- and that would be bad.
- Bad for who?

428
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:58,276
For that wrong person.

429
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,040
I don't give a fuck
about the "wrong person."

430
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,480
This doesn't
make any sense...

431
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:06,007
No, you got to care
about the wrong person!

432
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:08,076
The wrong person
is an innocent person.

433
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,680
He's the wrong person
for cheating on me, all right?

434
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:13,419
That's the wrong motherfucker
right there, okay?

435
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,485
Maybe we should dance.
You want to dance?

436
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:18,929
It's a slow song.

437
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:24,665
- No, I don't think so.
- Why? We never get to dance.

438
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,671
Yeah, I don't want to.

439
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:29,674
I can't right now.
I can't.

440
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,199
You dumb ass, can't you see
she is liquored up, horny?

441
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:33,973
Thank you.

442
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:37,107
- And you..."Oh, I don't want"...
- "I don't want to dance with my wife."

443
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:38,844
I'm sorry.

444
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:40,476
Fuck this, I'm going
over there now.

445
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,214
I'm not sitting here
jabbering with y'all...

446
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:46,657
Don't tell him
who told you and just kick his ass.

447
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:49,286
"My friend
so-and-so told me."

448
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:53,025
- I'm gonna tell him I heard.
- "I heard from so-and-so."

449
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,397
He thinks he can
go around L.A.

450
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,493
just eating pussy
left and right?

451
00:20:57,536 --> 00:21:00,630
No, uh-uh, you don't do that to me.
I'm out of here.

452
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:03,369
Wait, wait, wait.
Larry, walk Wanda out to her car.

453
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:05,843
- That's a good idea.
- What am I, a deterrent?

454
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:09,143
- It's a bad neighborhood.
- So, what am I gonna do?

455
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:14,048
- Larry?
- I'm in here.

456
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:19,150
Oh, Barbara
is a talker.

457
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:22,422
- Have you noticed that?
- Yeah, a little bit.

458
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:24,986
Why wouldn't you
dance with me?

459
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,294
I didn't want
to upset the widow.

460
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,029
What about upsetting your wife,
for one dance?

461
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:32,537
Have you ever seen
the look on a widow's face

462
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:35,131
when couples
are dancing?

463
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:36,573
They're with a friend,
then all of a sudden

464
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:38,474
- the friend starts dancing...
- What's the look?

465
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,002
- What's the look?
- They get depressed.

466
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:44,447
I think just one dance
she would've been okay.

467
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:46,610
You're really drunk,
aren't you?

468
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:48,279
- No.
- Huh? Listen to you.

469
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,948
- You're completely slurring your words.
- No, I'm not.

470
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,958
I have a question.

471
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:55,187
Yeah, I got a couple
of questions myself.

472
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:57,718
Okay, first of all,
you didn't...

473
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:00,823
you didn't tell her,
right? Wanda?

474
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:03,027
- I told you I didn't tell her.
- I know, I know.

475
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:06,697
The David promise.
I didn't tell her.

476
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:08,832
Yeah, a "David promise"
is worthless.

477
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:11,308
- It's really no good?
- It doesn't mean anything.

478
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:14,506
I have a question. What did you tell
Krazee-Eyez about oral sex?

479
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:19,475
- Oh.
- Yeah.

480
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:23,421
What did you say?

481
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,980
What did you say?
Why were you talking...

482
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:27,856
I just can't even
believe that.

483
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:30,555
- Boy, that guy.
- That guy?!

484
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:34,259
Yeah, what is he talking
to Wanda about that for?

485
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,790
We were having
a private conversation.

486
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:38,826
What did Wanda
tell you?

487
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:41,772
What did you tell
Krazee-Eyez?

488
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:45,743
I don't, you know...
do we need to discuss this?

489
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,541
I'm just curious.

490
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:50,173
Well, we were just...

491
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:51,739
You don't
want to do it?

492
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:53,649
No, it hurts my neck sometimes,
that's all I said.

493
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:55,950
- It hurts your neck?
- Sometimes it hurts my neck.

494
00:22:55,988 --> 00:22:59,082
- That's all I said.
- You think that's appropriate talk

495
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:02,150
at a party with someone
that you hardly even know?

496
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:04,321
- He started it.
- Is that appropriate?

497
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:07,025
What was I supposed to do?
Say it's inappropriate?

498
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:09,057
"Krazee-Eyez,
I think that subject's

499
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:10,659
a little inappropriate
for me, I'm sorry."

500
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:17,471
Holy shit, what is that?
Who's that?

501
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:21,005
- Ask who it is.
- Who is it?

502
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:23,014
It's Killa!

503
00:23:24,783 --> 00:23:27,547
Hold on a second.

504
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:29,850
Come on.
Hey, where's Larry at?

505
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:31,981
Larry!

506
00:23:32,024 --> 00:23:33,855
Oh, oh, shit.

507
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:37,726
He popping them fucking... Larry, I hear
you popping those fucking bubbles.

508
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:41,028
Get your ass down here!
Hey, Larry!

509
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:44,058
Hey, what the fuck?

510
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:47,231
Motherfucker, what the fuck?
Motherfucker, what the fuck?

511
00:23:47,272 --> 00:23:50,002
- What, Krazee-Eyez?
- Wanda fucking left me, man.

512
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:52,374
- What the fuck you say?
- I didn't say anything.

513
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:54,538
I know you said something,
motherfucker.

514
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,515
- No, Krazee-Eyez.
- You told, didn't you?

515
00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:59,244
- No, I swear to God.
- I thought we were "cool-de-la," man.

516
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:01,218
- I'm cool-de-la.
- We ain't cool-de-la?

517
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:04,552
- No, we are cool-de-la.
- Motherfucker, get my jacket.

518
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,356
- Krazee-Eyez...
- Get... don't make me come up there.

519
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:14,497
You fine,
you know that?

520
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:16,763
Krazee.

521
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:20,597
How you gonna throw the jacket
at me, motherfucker?

522
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:22,834
How you gonna throw
the jacket at me?

523
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,469
You ain't got no etiquette,
motherfucker. Man...

524
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:27,638
- Krazee-Eyez, l...
- I love that girl, man.

525
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,340
- I'm sorry.
- Well, you didn't act like it.

526
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:32,407
- What?
- You don't know.

527
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:34,476
That's not how you treat
somebody you love.

528
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,250
- Don't pay attention to her.
- That's not how you treat somebody.

529
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:38,881
I thought you were my nigga.
You ain't my nigga.

530
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:40,721
- I'm your nigga.
- You ain't shit.

531
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:43,193
- Krazee-Eyez...
- No, no, fuck that shit.

532
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:51,294
I have no jacket
for tomorrow, that's great.

533
00:24:54,606 --> 00:24:56,870
But my neck is
feeling pretty good.

534
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,861
Oh my God,
what are you doing?

535
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,001
What is... wait,
what's going on?

536
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,872
I think I swallowed
a pubic hair.

537
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:39,743
Oh, God.

538
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,951
Yeah, jump in, anytime.

539
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,515
Hey, Larry.
Hi, how are you?

540
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:50,187
Good. Joe, good to see you.
Welcome to L.A.

541
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:52,197
Listen, you know,
I lived here for a while,

542
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:55,200
but I was asked
to leave.

543
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:57,759
- Hey... I got a little problem.
- What's the matter?

544
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:04,201
I don't have the jacket
for the scene, you know?

545
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:08,771
- The one with the light... the light...
- The blue squares.

546
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:10,543
The window box designs.
You don't have it?

547
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:13,517
- What happened?
- The beige one. My wife threw it out.

548
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:15,747
Your wife
threw it out?

549
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:18,722
Excuse me, but how did your wife
get the jacket?

550
00:26:18,757 --> 00:26:22,124
The wardrobe woman must've
somehow misplaced it...

551
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,321
The thing is, obviously
I can't reshoot the whole scene.

552
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:25,887
I just can't do that,
we're killing...

553
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:27,831
the studio would say,
I don't think... Joe, what do...

554
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:31,393
It's okay, Marty.
I have a back-up jacket.

555
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:33,404
Perfect,
okay, here we are,

556
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:36,271
beautiful, perfect. Thank you,
thank you. How did this get here?

557
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:39,744
I have back-up
for all my wardrobe.

558
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:42,679
Well, why did you
tell me...

559
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:45,046
to make sure
to bring my jacket?

560
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:49,543
It's part of my wardrobe. You're not
supposed to take any wardrobe home.

561
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:51,715
Then how did you
get it...?

562
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:53,748
You took it home.

563
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:56,283
I wanted you
to bring it back.

564
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:58,694
- But I have an extra one.
- Good, okay.

565
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,755
Thank you, Wendy,
thank you, thank you.

566
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,131
All right, we got the jacket,
that's it.

567
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:05,136
Do you know the aggravation
this woman caused me?

568
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,138
I don't understand
how the hell she could've

569
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:08,935
given you a jacket to take home,
number one. I don't get it.

570
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:11,374
Well, then she gave me
the impression

571
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,038
that was the only jacket.
I was in possession of the only jacket.

572
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,707
- She made me think it was the only one.
- All right, we got the jacket.

573
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:18,682
- You understand what I'm saying?
- I understand.

574
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:20,184
We got the jacket, let's forget it.
We go,

575
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:24,052
get into make-up,
we go. That's it.

576
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:25,989
Why did she put it
in with my stuff?

577
00:27:26,024 --> 00:27:27,855
He's gonna
kill me, this guy.

578
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:30,691
Unbelievable. What does he mean,
she gave him the jacket

579
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:33,220
- to put in... what is this?
- It'll be all right.

580
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:35,165
Which way? Do I make
a left over here?

581
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,668
Yeah, just down
the corner to the left.

582
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:41,370
How many more scenes
do we have with him?

583
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:43,931
You should've seen
that cocksucker's face

584
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:46,467
when I took out
that knife.

585
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:50,447
He said to me,
he said, "You don't got no call."

586
00:27:50,482 --> 00:27:53,747
lmagine that?
"You don't got no call"?

587
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:57,744
I said, "I had call
yesterday...

588
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:59,518
I got call
today,

589
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:01,924
And I'll have
call tomorrow.

590
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:10,629
- What the hell is that?
- He's choking.

591
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:12,637
Cut it, cut!
