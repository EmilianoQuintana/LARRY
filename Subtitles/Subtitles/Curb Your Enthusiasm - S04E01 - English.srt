1
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:13,490
Pasta, if you like,
uh, very good.

2
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:25,839
What?
Because of what?

3
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:27,845
- Eh?
- What?

4
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,972
What's the sauce
with the fish?

5
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:32,482
What, what fish?
He didn't even mention the fish.

6
00:00:32,517 --> 00:00:34,849
- There was no fish.
- Was fish the second thing?

7
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,819
I'll just have the...

8
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:42,257
I'll just have
the first thing.

9
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:49,528
- Okay, and I'll have the second thing.
- Grazie.

10
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:52,866
They should write the thing down.
I don't know what he's talking about.

11
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:54,371
I've no idea
what we just ordered.

12
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,373
So guess what's coming up

13
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:58,807
in a few months?

14
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:02,108
I'm sure it's been on your mind.
Our anniversary.

15
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,546
- 10 years.
- 10-year anniversary.

16
00:01:04,582 --> 00:01:07,312
Boy, they just flew
right by, didn't they?

17
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:10,548
So, listen, I know
what I want.

18
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:14,217
I would like...
and just keep an open mind.

19
00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:16,522
- So remember our...
- Is it ever closed?

20
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:18,995
- Hmm-mm.
- Has it ever been closed to anything?

21
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,089
Okay.

22
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:22,895
Um...

23
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:25,095
I would like
for us to renew our vows

24
00:01:25,136 --> 00:01:27,263
and have a real
wedding ceremony.

25
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,440
You got it.

26
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:32,703
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?

27
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:34,540
- Nothing big, small.
- Okay, no no, yeah.

28
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,877
- Friends, family that kind of thing.
- Right.

29
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:39,314
Oh my gosh, I can't believe
you just said yes to that.

30
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,113
I'll tell you what,
you just built it all up.

31
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:44,315
I did. I didn't know how I was
gonna bring it up, but thank you.

32
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,585
- You thought it was gonna be a fight.
- Yeah yeah.

33
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:49,092
Now let's talk about
my 10th anniversary present.

34
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:51,151
All right.
What would you like?

35
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:56,693
I believe my present
has already been agreed upon.

36
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:58,725
- Really?
- Yes.

37
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:02,432
- It's not ringing a bell?
- What are you talking about?

38
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:04,737
- We already talked about it?
- Here, at this restaurant.

39
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:07,710
- Really?
- 10 years ago, before we got married.

40
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:09,975
In these seats.
Same seats.

41
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:13,711
I feel like we're
married already.

42
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:18,313
We're just making it legal.
It's just gonna be, you know, permanent

43
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:20,324
And...

44
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:23,623
My friends think I'm crazy,
but I do. I just...

45
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:25,822
Wait a minute. They think
you're crazy? How dare they?

46
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:27,831
Well, that's what I say.

47
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:29,628
Which friends
think you're crazy?

48
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:32,568
I don't want to name names,
but look it's working, right?

49
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:36,061
Who, Julie? She thinks...
she thinks you're crazy?

50
00:02:36,107 --> 00:02:38,234
I just think that we should
be a family, you know?

51
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:40,938
We should share the same last name.
I want to be Cheryl David.

52
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:44,106
- What do you want to be a David for?
- I want to be your wife...

53
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:46,013
Davids want to be
out of being Davids.

54
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,984
I don't want to be a David,
I have to be a David.

55
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:50,010
But if you don't have to be
a David, why be a David?

56
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:52,284
I feel like I have to be
a David.

57
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:57,090
Is it... are you worried
about not being able to have sex

58
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:00,393
with someone else for the rest
of your life? Is that what?

59
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,867
- Where did you get that? No.
- Because you know what?

60
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:08,165
Okay okay.

61
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:12,835
How about if we get married now...
like, right now...

62
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:16,779
for our 10-year anniversary,
you can have sex with someone else?

63
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:19,214
What?!

64
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,276
If that's
your hold up here,

65
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,447
then let's just do that.

66
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:27,946
Come on, you're not
gonna let me do that.

67
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:29,960
- What are you saying that for?
- I will.

68
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:33,157
Just sex one time.

69
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:35,358
It's not a big deal.

70
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:43,939
- Oh, right!
- Aha-aah.

71
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,808
- Right.
- Aah.

72
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:51,645
- I can't believe you remember that.
- Yes, I did remember.

73
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:54,412
Wow, you have
a good memory.

74
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:56,147
For some things.

75
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:58,485
- Yeah.
- Yeah, for some things.

76
00:03:58,522 --> 00:04:00,490
All right, well,
all right.

77
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:03,550
Then I said you could
have sex with somebody

78
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:05,653
and you should do that.
It's our 10th anniversary.

79
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:08,130
- You should do it.
- I'm joking. I'm not gonna do it.

80
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,633
- I'm not gonna hold you up to it.
- No, you should.

81
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,363
I said it 10 years ago.

82
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:15,236
You should go out and
have sex with someone.

83
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:17,263
- No no, it's nice, but...
- No no no no.

84
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:20,038
thank you. That's sweet
that you wanted... you know.

85
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:23,240
- I'm insisting on it.
- You want to keep your word.

86
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,807
No, because if you think
you can have sex with somebody else,

87
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:29,217
then you should do that.

88
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:30,720
What does that mean?

89
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:32,848
You're gonna go up and...

90
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,791
"Hey, lady.
I'm Larry David

91
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:39,091
And my wife said I could have sex
with somebody tonight."

92
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,031
- First of all, I'm insulted, okay?
- You are?

93
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:44,034
Even if I wanted to,
you don't think I'm capable of it.

94
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:47,060
No, I don't think
you're capable of it.

95
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:49,766
I really don't.

96
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:54,507
That's why I think
you, um...

97
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,240
- So if I do this...
- Hmm-mm.

98
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,271
Just so there's no
misunderstanding here,

99
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,715
- it's okay with you?
- Hmm-mm.

100
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:02,446
If you find somebody
and say, "hey"...

101
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,954
- I don't want to hear any crying.
- No.

102
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:06,980
...and say, "I can't
believe you did that.

103
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:10,892
- Why did you do that?" Huh?
- No, I would not be crying.

104
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:13,453
Oh boy, all right.
Well, thank you.

105
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:15,965
- Thank you for my anniversary present.
- You're welcome.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,558
How long do I have
to do this?

107
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:21,037
You have until our anniversary
and that's it.

108
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,564
Good luck.

109
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:30,070
I just hope Jeff is gonna
be at that karaoke party

110
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:33,277
Because I have got a lot to say
to that young man.

111
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:35,945
Listen, maybe we should skip
the karaoke party.

112
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,510
Why do you want
to skip karaoke?

113
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:39,682
- Oh, it's horrible. Why don't we just... -
Horrible?

114
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:41,918
Listen, why don't we
go home and I'll...

115
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,950
I'll make it
worth your while.

116
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,629
I kind of wanna
go to karaoke.

117
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:52,369
Oh my god.

118
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,174
# Just in time #

119
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:06,149
# Found you
just in time #

120
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:10,313
# Before you came,
my time... #

121
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:12,618
Do you know married men
everywhere,

122
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:15,682
that's their dream that their wife
says, "Yeah, go ahead."

123
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:17,193
What's Mel doing here?

124
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:19,458
Frank's been in,
like, two of his movies.

125
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:21,192
- You didn't know that?
- Oh...

126
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:22,358
They're old friends.

127
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,301
#... My bridges
all were crossed #

128
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:27,861
# Nowhere to go... #

129
00:06:27,905 --> 00:06:31,807
This is great! You got permission.
Come on, man.

130
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:33,707
She actually
challenged me to do it.

131
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:35,939
- Damn it, man, do it!
- She was laughing at me.

132
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,641
You've got to, man.

133
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,649
Whom I am supposed
to do this with?

134
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:42,516
I don't know, there's got to be
somebody you thought about.

135
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:45,579
That doesn't mean I could walk up
to them and do anything.

136
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:47,090
But now you've
got permission.

137
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:49,592
This is the thing that
I'm the worst at in the world, this.

138
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:50,821
This and drawing.

139
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:53,796
It's a big thing to do.
How could I do that?

140
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,458
Do you think
I could do it?

141
00:06:57,301 --> 00:07:01,032
- Yeah, huh? What about it?
- Yeah, go, Daddy-o, go.

142
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:03,403
- Practice. It's a start, go.
- Okay, fine. Yeah.

143
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,932
You want to see how
inept I really am, huh?

144
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:10,140
- I want to see you in action.
- Do you want to see this?

145
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,877
Just go. Yeah, go make a move.
Show me. Just practice.

146
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:15,283
I'll watch.
Go ahead.

147
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,153
#... Hey, now
you're here #

148
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,957
# And now I know just
where I'm going... #

149
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:27,452
- Do you like karaoke?
- Yeah.

150
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,331
It's good, you know.
Something to do at night.

151
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,337
What can you do at night?
Bowling, movies.

152
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,067
It's like a third thing to do
after bowling and the movies.

153
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:39,268
I don't know if you bowl.
I don't go that often,

154
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,837
But it's fun, it's fun. You can't
find a ball, that's the problem.

155
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,713
I don't know, maybe you own
a bowling ball. I don't own one.

156
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:47,649
My whole life, every time
I'm in a bowling alley

157
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:51,519
Sticking my fingers in all these holes,
picking up the balls.

158
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,888
You gotta get your own ball.
I don't bowl enough to get my own ball.

159
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:56,449
It takes up a lot
of space in the house.

160
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:58,120
You keep looking at it
in the closet going,

161
00:07:58,162 --> 00:08:00,824
"What I am doing with a bowling ball?
I don't even bowl."

162
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,661
You know what I mean?

163
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,998
So you don't want
to get rid of the ball.

164
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:07,526
How do you get rid of a bowling ball?
Think about that.

165
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:11,337
Who do you give a bowling ball to?
Nobody bowls.

166
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,468
The thing,
it only fits your fingers.

167
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,239
You throw a bowling ball
in the garbage can,

168
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,179
you know what that
sanitation man's gonna do?

169
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:19,739
He's gonna knock on your door,
that's how upset he's gonna be.

170
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:22,877
He's gonna say, "Who the fuck
threw a bowling ball in the garbage?

171
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,414
Okay, all right.

172
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:32,288
I'm around town.

173
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:36,997
#... Then you changed
my lonely life... #

174
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:38,365
How did it go?

175
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:42,862
#... That lucky day #

176
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:46,205
# Hey, my lonely,
lonely life #

177
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:50,043
# That lucky day. #

178
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:55,042
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you very much.

179
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:01,557
Come on, everybody.
Put it together! Mel Brooks.

180
00:09:01,592 --> 00:09:04,083
How about that?

181
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,686
That was fantastic.

182
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:08,254
All right, now, who wants to go next?
Anyone?

183
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,494
- Look, hey, Larry David.
- Oh, come on.

184
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:12,024
What do you say, Larry?

185
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:14,003
- Come up and give us a song?
- Oh come on.

186
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:16,666
- Come on, Lar.
- You gotta be kidding.

187
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:18,072
- Come on.
- Are you crazy?

188
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:20,906
Oh, would you stop?
Oh, you people...

189
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:23,936
Oh, me? No.
I can't do it.

190
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,949
All right.

191
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:27,245
Oh, shut up!

192
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:32,315
All right,
all right.

193
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:37,990
# I've been away
from you a long time #

194
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:40,895
# I never thought
I'd miss you so #

195
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:44,560
# Somehow I feel
your love is real #

196
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:48,833
# Swanee, you're calling me
you crazy river #

197
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:50,601
# Swanee #

198
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,609
# How I love you,
how I love you #

199
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:56,511
# My dear old Swanee... #

200
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:58,410
So what do you think
Mel Brooks wants?

201
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:00,508
I have no idea.
Usually I know.

202
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:03,850
- He called out of the clear blue sky?
- Out of the clear blue sky.

203
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:05,320
He's one of my idols,
you know?

204
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:07,790
I know he is.
That's why I was excited for you.

205
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:12,026
- Hey!
- I'll call... I'll call you back.

206
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:14,860
- What the hell are you doing?
- What the fuck are you doing?

207
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:16,297
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

208
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,891
What the fuck?
I'm trying to walk.

209
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,562
While you're talking
on a cell phone?

210
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:21,230
You almost killed me,
douche bag!

211
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:23,262
You cut right in front of me
talking on the phone?

212
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:25,207
There's a law against
talking on a cell phone?

213
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:28,234
No, you can't, not while you're wheeling
around. You almost hit my car.

214
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:29,870
I'm trying to get
to my car, you fuckin'...

215
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:31,540
Learn how to drive
that thing.

216
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:33,982
- Piss off, you douche bag. You pussy.
- Asshole!

217
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:36,315
Piss off!

218
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,055
Hey,

219
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:45,289
- Look at this.
- Yeah?

220
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:47,388
Wow, there's
money in here.

221
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:02,968
Larry David,
Jeff Greene to see Mel.

222
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:04,981
He'll be with you in a second.
Have a seat.

223
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:08,644
You know what?
I found this thing in the lobby.

224
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:10,516
Oh.

225
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:12,954
I don't know
what the deal is.

226
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,981
Uh, actually this
belongs to Dennis.

227
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,890
He does the computers
in the building.

228
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,191
It probably fell out
of his chair this morning.

229
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:22,130
- Chair?
- Yeah, he's in a wheelchair.

230
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,862
I'll bet that's the guy.
You know that?

231
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:28,861
A guy in a wheelchair cut right in front
of my car in the parking lot.

232
00:11:28,906 --> 00:11:30,635
I almost hit him.

233
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:32,198
The guy was talking
on his cell phone.

234
00:11:32,242 --> 00:11:35,040
Yeah, well, he's in a...
he's in a wheelchair.

235
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:36,943
Yeah, I know.
It's a moving vehicle.

236
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,312
There's got to be some kind
of regulations I would think,

237
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:41,579
- even for people in electric chairs.
- Hmm-mm.

238
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,313
He's motoring along.

239
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:46,914
You don't need to be talking
on a cell phone. It's dangerous.

240
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,289
Mel will be right out.

241
00:11:49,326 --> 00:11:52,022
- "Names 4 Babies"? Is that you?
- Yes.

242
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:55,190
Yes, actually my partner and I
are adopting a baby.

243
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:57,723
You got yourself
a partner.

244
00:11:57,768 --> 00:11:59,565
- I got a wife.
- Hmm.

245
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:03,835
Not exactly a partner.
More like... a rival.

246
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:07,571
You know what I mean?
It's a rivalry.

247
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:10,307
I wish I could say
this is my partner.

248
00:12:10,347 --> 00:12:13,646
So let me ask you, you got any...
you got any names picked out?

249
00:12:13,684 --> 00:12:15,777
Uh, actually we do.

250
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,219
- Is it a boy? What are you adopting?
- It's a boy,

251
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:20,155
And we are adopting him
from China.

252
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,784
- Ah, adopting from China.
- Hmm-mm.

253
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,817
Chinese names.
Do I know any Chinese names?

254
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:26,557
Well you got, uh...

255
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:31,000
you got Wang from the Good Earth.
Remember Wang Lung?

256
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:34,003
Wang isn't a bad
first name. Wang?

257
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:36,801
Then you got
the whole Ang family.

258
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,833
Fang, Bang... Tang.

259
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:42,903
Tang is not actually
a bad name,

260
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:45,608
'cause it's like China
but it's... it's not China.

261
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:49,449
It's a juice
is what it is.

262
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:51,545
Tang...

263
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:53,522
Is that so bad naming
a kid after a juice?

264
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:54,956
Maybe that's not so bad.

265
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:57,586
But it has Chinese
overtones... Tang.

266
00:12:57,628 --> 00:12:59,459
- But yet there's a...
- Tang...

267
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:01,464
- You got a little jolt with it.
- Hmm-mm, yeah.

268
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:03,898
I don't think that would go over
too well with the schoolkids.

269
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:07,131
Uh, that's gonna be the least
of his problems, no?

270
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,103
Mel will be
right with you.

271
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,973
You know what?
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.

272
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,376
I'll be right back.

273
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,350
Oh my God, what...

274
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,084
Larry! Larry David.

275
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:29,752
Oh my God!

276
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:31,658
Ooh, did I hurt you?
I'm so sorry.

277
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:34,255
- Is it bad? Is it bad?
- No, it'll be all right.

278
00:13:34,298 --> 00:13:36,357
- Is it bad?
- No, let me get some help.

279
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,265
- Is it bad?
- Don't move. Don't move.

280
00:13:38,302 --> 00:13:40,998
Oh, my God... hurry up.

281
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:49,209
Hi. Jeff Greene. I'm a patient
of Dr. Morrison's.

282
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,907
- I called about Larry David.
- Oh yeah.

283
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:53,644
Just sign in and the doctor
will be with you in a minute.

284
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:55,208
Oh.

285
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,516
Do I actually have to put my name
on this thing?

286
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:59,579
Yes. Yeah.

287
00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:02,353
I generally don't like
to put my name on these lists.

288
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:05,589
- People come in, they see your name.
- Just... just sign in.

289
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:07,028
Just sign in.

290
00:14:07,064 --> 00:14:08,793
I don't like having
my name on these lists.

291
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:12,063
Then sign Ben Vereen.
Who cares what you sign? Come on.

292
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,070
Your head's bleeding.
Just sign in!

293
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,197
Yes.

294
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,066
- Hello?
- Dude.

295
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,398
- What are you doing?
- What?

296
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:47,665
What are you calling me
on the doctor's phone for-

297
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:49,638
I'm bored to death in here.

298
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:52,198
Don't use the doctor's phone.
That's not right.

299
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:54,233
- What's the big deal?
- They don't like it.

300
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:56,108
Well, I just thought
I'd give you a call,

301
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,410
See what's up, how you're doing.
What are you reading?

302
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,882
- "Men's Fest... Fitness."
- "Men's Fitness"?

303
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:04,717
Yeah, about
America's fattest cities.

304
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:06,882
Oh, you know what?
There's the doctor.

305
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,322
All right, I'll talk
to you later.

306
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:11,191
I will, uh,
I'll talk to you later.

307
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,792
That was Jeff.

308
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,824
You're not supposed
to use that phone.

309
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,368
Sorry.
It was a local call.

310
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:25,136
You're not supposed
to use the phone.

311
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,837
It doesn't matter whether it was
a local or a long distance call.

312
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:30,779
We just don't want people
using that phone, okay?

313
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:34,511
- What's the big deal, if I may ask?
- It's no big deal.

314
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:36,246
What's the problem?

315
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:41,019
There is no problem. We just
don't want people using that phone.

316
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:43,925
I don't understand
why not, though.

317
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,518
Why couldn't I use it?

318
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:48,258
Well, you could use it.
You obviously did.

319
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:49,959
We don't want you
to use it, though.

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,230
With all due respect,
I don't understand the rule.

321
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:54,169
I don't see
what the big deal is.

322
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,933
The history of how
we arrived at that

323
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:58,668
Is so complex that I won't
even bore you with it.

324
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,337
Just let it be said
that we don't allow anyone

325
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,812
To use the phones
in the examination rooms.

326
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:05,974
I just don't see how
it's hurting anybody.

327
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:08,007
It's not
hurting anybody.

328
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,952
We just have a rule.
You don't use the doctor's phone.

329
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:12,978
I just don't understand
what the reason is.

330
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:15,116
You're saying not to use it,
but what's the reason?

331
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:17,490
I don't understand
why you have to know the reason.

332
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:19,825
I'm just trying to understand
why you decided that.

333
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:21,854
It seems very
capricious to me.

334
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,627
You know, it's hard
to make a rule

335
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:25,692
that takes in all
the contingencies.

336
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,000
So we just have a rule.
Don't use the phone.

337
00:16:28,038 --> 00:16:29,938
- Okay.
- Okay?

338
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:32,635
- Understood.
- All right. Glad you understand it.

339
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:34,667
So what happened to you?
Let's have a look.

340
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:36,702
I got hit by a door.

341
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,580
Wow. Sit down,
will you?

342
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:41,447
Mel Brooks is coming
out of a bathroom

343
00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:43,510
And he... a swinging
door hit me.

344
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:46,078
- Yeah, Mel Brooks, huh?
- Yeah.

345
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:48,683
- Is it the Mel Brooks? The funny guy?
- Uh-huh.

346
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:51,125
I like Mel Brooks. I'm a big fan.
Lay down, will you?

347
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:53,629
- Yeah, he's great.
- Put your head on the pillow.

348
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:55,756
I have tickets for his play
"The Producers."

349
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,198
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

350
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:58,633
- I hear it's great.
- So do I.

351
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:02,001
Boy this is a...
kind of a nasty cut.

352
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:04,438
All right, I think all we
have to do here is clean this up

353
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:06,408
and put in
a few stitches.

354
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,603
- Oh really?
- Hmm-mm.

355
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:08,872
Oh, okay.

356
00:17:08,912 --> 00:17:11,142
Again I'm sorry about
the... the phone stuff.

357
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:14,150
Oh, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

358
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:17,517
Just... if you're ever in a doctor's
office again, don't use the phone.

359
00:17:17,554 --> 00:17:20,216
Yeah, it just seems
like an odd policy to me, though.

360
00:17:20,257 --> 00:17:23,988
It's a rule that is universal
in examination rooms.

361
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:27,428
- You don't use the phone.
- The rule doesn't make any sense.

362
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,932
- It makes sense to us.
- Okay, fine.

363
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,093
We don't have many rules here.
That's one of them.

364
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,626
It seems odd, though,
that if you're making a local call

365
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:37,071
that anybody would care,
but whatever.

366
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:39,735
It's not the expense of the call
we're concerned about.

367
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:41,744
I don't know if you've ever had
stitches before,

368
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:44,212
but there is a slight
bit of pain involved.

369
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:46,477
Nothing more, I would say,
than a little prick.

370
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:48,916
Yeah, there's definitely
a prick involved.

371
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:50,681
Uh, yes, there is
a prick involved.

372
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,711
Yeah, there's
one prick involved.

373
00:17:52,756 --> 00:17:54,849
Yeah, I'd say there is
one prick involved.

374
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:57,724
I agree. I'm not a doctor,
but I agree there is one prick.

375
00:17:57,761 --> 00:17:58,750
Yep.

376
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:03,255
And the more I look at this,
I think this is pretty minor.

377
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:15,034
What the hell?

378
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:19,478
You drooled on me!

379
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,522
So have you thought about anybody
for the 10th anniversary present?

380
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,459
I have been
thinking about it.

381
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:36,522
And?

382
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,699
You know,
I got three months.

383
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:43,103
I'm gonna take my time

384
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:45,630
and wait... wait
for the right one.

385
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:48,109
And you, my fat friend,
will be the first to know.

386
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:49,941
All right, good.
I should be.

387
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,777
My big fat friend.

388
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,811
Hmm, fatso...
Yeah, fatso.

389
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:02,451
Oh, hey.

390
00:19:02,492 --> 00:19:04,517
Did you get
your wallet?

391
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:09,294
- Yeah. How did you know about that?
- I found it.

392
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:13,392
- Wait. You're the guy from the car.
- Yeah.

393
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:15,961
Joanne gave it to me
in Mel Brooks's office.

394
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:17,906
Yeah right, right.
I gave it to her.

395
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:20,569
That's not
what she said.

396
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,011
- Wait. She said she found that wallet?
- Yes.

397
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,844
That's an exact quote,
"I found this"?

398
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:29,079
She said she found the wallet,
gave it to me and I gave her 100 bucks.

399
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,145
Seriously, you should worry
a little bit less about the wallet

400
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:35,954
And maybe maintain a little focus
on your driving skills, buddy.

401
00:19:37,661 --> 00:19:39,185
Hello.

402
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:41,060
Jeff Greene, Larry David
to see Mel.

403
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,998
- Okay.
- Okay.

404
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:50,629
You know, I ran into the guy
in the wheelchair downstairs.

405
00:19:50,674 --> 00:19:52,335
Your friend, Dennis.

406
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,900
He told me that you said
that you found the wallet,

407
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,970
and he gave you
$100 reward?

408
00:19:57,013 --> 00:19:58,446
What's up with that?

409
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:00,779
- How dare you come in here...
- How dare I?

410
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:03,285
...and accuse me...
- Hey, what's going on?

411
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,481
This is the guy
that I told you about.

412
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:07,820
Oh, you got a problem
with our lifestyle?

413
00:20:07,857 --> 00:20:09,757
- That we want to adopt a baby?
- Not at all.

414
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,920
Yeah. You need a good
fuckin' ass kicking.

415
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,556
That's what you need!
You want to name our baby Tang?!

416
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:17,225
You think it's good to name a kid
after a breakfast drink?!

417
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:20,361
We don't think that's a good name!
Do you understand that?

418
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:23,099
- I understand.
- Damn fucking right!

419
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,664
You apologize to her.
You apologize now!

420
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:28,143
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

421
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:29,475
What are you doing
here anyway?

422
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:31,275
I got a meeting
with Mel Brooks.

423
00:20:35,785 --> 00:20:39,448
- Well, you're here. You came.
- Yes.

424
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,424
And I guess
you're wondering

425
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:44,552
why I called you.

426
00:20:44,594 --> 00:20:46,619
Kind of, yeah.

427
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,325
Do you remember
the other night

428
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:52,893
I sang at the karaoke club
and then you got up?

429
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:57,202
- Yeah, he was great.
- The audience went pretty wild for me

430
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,573
and then
you sang "Swanee"

431
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,202
and they went crazy.

432
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:06,511
And when you sang,
I was absolutely floored.

433
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:08,915
I mean, l...
you think l...

434
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:11,386
- Really?
- No no, I couldn't get over it.

435
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:15,118
And bang bang,

436
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:16,489
something went
off in me.

437
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,721
In a couple of months,

438
00:21:18,762 --> 00:21:21,128
the guy playing
Max Bialystock

439
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:23,462
will be going out
on the road,

440
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,300
leaving an empty slot
called Max Bialystock,

441
00:21:27,337 --> 00:21:30,465
the leading character
in "The Producers."

442
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:33,135
I want you,
Larry David,

443
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:36,475
to be the next
Max Bialystock on Broadway.

444
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:41,308
I would like you to play the lead
in "The Producers."

445
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:47,419
When this thing goes off,
I'm never wrong... the guy has to be...

446
00:21:47,457 --> 00:21:50,949
l... l... I don't,
I mean, I'm...

447
00:21:50,994 --> 00:21:53,758
I don't know
what to say, I'm...

448
00:21:53,797 --> 00:21:56,322
- Were you great?
- Well, Mel, I mean, you know...

449
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:58,926
- He was great. -
...a Broadway show... I've never...

450
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:01,334
I'm not, like
a theater actor.

451
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:03,498
When we made the movie
of "The Producers,"

452
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,374
The guy that played Carmen Ghia was
this incredible, talented greek actor.

453
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,402
His name is Andreas,
Andreas Voutsinas.

454
00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:12,642
And Andreas used
to say to me...

455
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:16,115
"Or you got it
or you ain't."

456
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:18,848
I said, "Andreas, you can't
start a sentence with 'or."'

457
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:22,255
He said, "Never mind.
Or you got it, or you ain't."

458
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:23,850
You got it, Larry.

459
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:26,293
- You got it, Larry.
- You got it, mister.

460
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:28,991
Mr. Brooks is right,
my friend, you got it.

461
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:32,627
Oh, by the way, Ben Stiller
will be taking over at the same time.

462
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:35,570
So it will be Larry David
and Ben Stiller.

463
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,573
I got a great idea.

464
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,370
Go to the show tonight.
See the show.

465
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:42,003
Let it get into your pores,
let it get into your system.

466
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:44,536
I'm telling you I'm never wrong.
I am never wrong.

467
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:47,141
I know it sounds crazy to you.
I know it sounds insane.

468
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:50,243
- It doesn't sound crazy to me.
- You were born to do it.

469
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,754
- It sounds like a joke.
- No joke here.

470
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,917
It's like Allen Funt or Jamie Kennedy's
gonna come walking through the door.

471
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,688
You were born to do it.

472
00:22:57,727 --> 00:22:59,786
Just see the show tonight,
see what happens.

473
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:02,423
See what happens and then let this
all come back to you.

474
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,831
Okay?

475
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:07,769
- You're gonna do it. It's gonna happen.
- He's going to do it.

476
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,898
Okay, Jeff, tell him in the elevator.
Tell him how great he is.

477
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,204
- Gentlemen, a pleasure.
- Take care.

478
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,734
I did all the plays in high school.
I swear to God.

479
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:18,042
They gave me the lead,
every one.

480
00:23:18,081 --> 00:23:20,413
Are your M4 and M5?
Are those your house seats?

481
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,079
They'll be there.
Pick 'em up at the box office.

482
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,089
- Larry David, yeah.
- Thank you.

483
00:23:27,123 --> 00:23:30,957
Giant fuckin' mistake
if I say so right to your face.

484
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,962
- Okay, Zero Mostel...
- Yeah, I know.

485
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,260
I know what
you're gonna say.

486
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:39,132
Nathan Lane, Jason Alexander
and Larry David?

487
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,603
- Come on, Mel.
- Trust me.

488
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:44,835
When I know, I know.
And this time, I know.

489
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,990
Thank you very much.

490
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:06,154
All right.
What's wrong?

491
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:09,188
Aw, this thing's
killing me.

492
00:24:09,232 --> 00:24:11,564
You know, I'm gonna
take a painkiller, I think.

493
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:13,330
- I don't think you should do that.
- Why?

494
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,929
- Don't they make you tired?
- So what?

495
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:17,599
It's killing me.
It really hurts.

496
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,267
How are you gonna
take it without water?

497
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:21,869
- I don't know. Pop it in.
- Maybe you should wait.

498
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:28,946
Okay okay.
Okay, Larry.

499
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,114
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

500
00:24:33,156 --> 00:24:34,851
Ben Stiller?

501
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,985
- Yeah, I think that is.
- Hey.

502
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:40,889
Hi.

503
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,491
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Good to see you.

504
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:46,661
- Nice to see you.
- We met that one time at the...

505
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:48,261
- Hi.
- Hi, Ben.

506
00:24:48,304 --> 00:24:51,102
- Oh good, thank you.
- Nice to see you.

507
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,870
- You okay?
- Yeah, what happened?

508
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,038
Mel Brooks hit me
with a bathroom door.

509
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,604
Cut my head.

510
00:24:58,648 --> 00:25:00,548
- I know, it sounds like a joke.
- Really?

511
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,017
What, were you
talking to him?

512
00:25:03,052 --> 00:25:04,485
I met him today.

513
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,044
Oh, you met him today?

514
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,182
So he told me
you're doing the show.

515
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:10,089
I am, yeah.
I'm doing the show.

516
00:25:10,126 --> 00:25:11,923
So you were talking
to him about maybe...

517
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:13,656
- He...
- Yeah...

518
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:17,860
He offered me
the Max Bialystock.

519
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,562
Yeah, I know.

520
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,468
- It was a little shocking to me too.
- What?!

521
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:24,268
You mean,
he actually offered...

522
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:25,672
- Yeah.
- Really?

523
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:28,905
Offered him the...
I know.

524
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:29,912
- That is...
- Crazy!

525
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,846
Are you guys
just going cra...

526
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:34,975
Because it took him a long time
to make this decision.

527
00:25:35,018 --> 00:25:38,545
- Well, yeah, we...
- Can I ask you something. You act?

528
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:41,917
- I know you're...
- No, I don't.

529
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,619
Yeah, and you sing?

530
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,787
I don't do anything, really.

531
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:47,523
They'll have to teach me.

532
00:25:47,563 --> 00:25:50,396
- Right, right.
- He saw me in a karaoke bar.

533
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:52,401
- Wow.
- You're fucking with me, right?

534
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:54,403
No, it's true, but I'm still
thinking about it.

535
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:57,167
- I haven't made up my mind.
- You should think about it.

536
00:25:57,206 --> 00:26:00,039
Honey, actually I see Brian and Lee.
We should go say hi.

537
00:26:00,076 --> 00:26:01,703
- Bless you.
- Gesundheit.

538
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:03,769
Good to see you.
See you later.

539
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,475
- Well, whatever happens happens.
- Good to see you.

540
00:26:06,516 --> 00:26:10,509
Lar, good luck.
This is a big decision. Take care.

541
00:26:10,553 --> 00:26:12,521
I'll watch it tonight
and think about it.

542
00:26:12,555 --> 00:26:15,786
- Good luck. Whatever happens, it'll...
- Ben, so good to see you.

543
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,759
And we'll talk about
apartments if you need to.

544
00:26:17,794 --> 00:26:20,422
- I'm sure we'll all gonna be seeing...
- I know.

545
00:26:20,463 --> 00:26:22,090
- I'll check it out.
- Yeah.

546
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:24,395
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

547
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:30,632
- What is wrong with you?
- What are you talking about?

548
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,665
Why didn't you shake his hand?
He put his hand out for you.

549
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,575
He sneezed
all over his hand.

550
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:38,011
- But he just sneezed on it.
- How rude is that?

551
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:40,345
He didn't
notice anything.

552
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:43,318
- He put his hand out to shake.
- Oh, please.

553
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,719
Of course he noticed that.
Everyone noticed that.

554
00:26:45,755 --> 00:26:48,952
I'm not going to shake his hand.
It's got snot all over it, come on.

555
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:50,982
Partners, Leo,
all the way.

556
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:54,087
And nothing or no one
will ever come between us.

557
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,394
Nothing or no one, Max.

558
00:26:56,432 --> 00:26:58,764
- Come in.
- Come in.

559
00:27:04,941 --> 00:27:07,375
I'm back down
from the pills.

560
00:27:08,945 --> 00:27:12,972
Oh, about our 10th
anniversary present...

561
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:14,778
- Okay.
...it's...

562
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:17,877
- It's fine if you want out of it.
- No.

563
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,615
Believe me, I will not
think any less of you.

564
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:22,818
No, I don't want to get out of it.
A deal's a deal.

565
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:25,692
I just want to tell you
that there's a few ground rules

566
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:28,788
that we need
to talk about, okay?

567
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:31,322
Okay, rule
number one is,

568
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:33,801
it's a one time only.

569
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:35,804
Okay, one time only.

570
00:27:35,838 --> 00:27:38,033
And there's a deadline.

571
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:41,373
It's our anniversary at midnight,
then it's over.

572
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:43,402
Yeah, kind of like
Cinderella.

573
00:27:44,614 --> 00:27:46,104
- And by the way...
- Yeah?

574
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:49,312
- If I do this show on Broadway?
- yeah.

575
00:27:49,352 --> 00:27:52,048
My opening night is the same night
as our anniversary.

576
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:55,216
Really?
That would be fun.

577
00:27:55,258 --> 00:28:00,491
# When you got it,
flaunt it #

578
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:05,092
# Show your assets,
let them know you're proud... #

579
00:28:05,134 --> 00:28:07,659
What do you think?
You think you want to do the show?

580
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:10,103
#... Stick your chest out,
shake your tush #

581
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:11,868
# When you go in... #

582
00:28:11,908 --> 00:28:13,466
You know,
maybe I will.

583
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:18,270
Maybe I will.

584
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,788
#... When you got it... #
