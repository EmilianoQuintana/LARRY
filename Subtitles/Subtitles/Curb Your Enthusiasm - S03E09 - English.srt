1
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:22,999
- Hey, Larry.
- Hey.

2
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:24,936
- How are you?
- Okay.

3
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:28,168
Good.
Hey, listen, is this true?

4
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,301
Did I hear that you were
at the U2 concert last night?

5
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:34,143
I got to tell you, man,
I been thinking about that

6
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:37,207
- and I can't see you there.
- My wife dragged me there.

7
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,911
- She had these tickets...
- Uh-huh.

8
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:41,443
So I did it as
a favor to my wife.

9
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:43,285
It's a little
embarrassing to me.

10
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:45,450
Don't be embarrassed.
You like to rock and roll.

11
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:47,926
How'd you know
I was at the U2 concert?

12
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:49,656
Well, you know Marge,
at the front.

13
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:51,630
She called to confirm
your appointment,

14
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:54,065
your housekeeper told her
that you had been there.

15
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:57,332
My housekeeper told Marge
I was at the U2 concert?

16
00:00:57,371 --> 00:01:00,932
That's what...
apparently, yeah.

17
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:04,341
Yeah. I didn't know you were
into the rock and roll thing.

18
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:06,642
I'm not. You know,
I don't like the idea

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,875
that everything I do
people are finding out about

20
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:10,780
through my housekeeper,
that's all.

21
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:13,149
Hey, I don't know
what else you did yesterday.

22
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:16,622
That's the only thing
I know about yesterday.

23
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:18,487
Well, don't mention to anybody
that I was at the U2 concert,

24
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,516
- if you can.
- All right.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,690
Let's move past that.
What do we got going on here?

26
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:27,700
I have something
stuck in my throat.

27
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:29,793
- Let me see.
- I got a...

28
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:33,997
I got a pubic hair.

29
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:37,875
You got a pubic hair
in your throat?

30
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:39,173
- Yeah...
- All right, hey.

31
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:43,148
Well, let's take
a look at it then.

32
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:46,582
That's not
that unusual.

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,281
I got people in here all the time
with stuff stuck in their throat.

34
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,754
Generally,
between you and me,

35
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,884
it's not something
I do that often...

36
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:55,087
You know what?
Don't even need to know the schedule.

37
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:57,187
- I know, I'm just...
- Let's just take...

38
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,994
Up, open for me.
There it is.

39
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:01,898
Yeah, I see it.
I see it back there.

40
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:03,903
It's pretty far back,
and it's kind of...

41
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:06,303
it's kind of wrapped
itself around.

42
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:08,534
So... I can get it
if you want me to.

43
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:10,941
But...
I'll tell you now,

44
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:12,740
it's gonna be a little painful for you.
It's gonna hurt.

45
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:15,213
Frankly, it's gonna hurt.
There is the other alternative,

46
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:17,443
which is...
kind of flush it out.

47
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:20,453
Take some liquids and it will flush out.
Three days at the most.

48
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:24,685
Jesus, it's stuck in there
and it's scratching me.

49
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,716
I just feel like I can get it up
but I can't.

50
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:30,195
I know, your choice.
Happy to go in and get it if you'd like.

51
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,098
Or you can let it
come on out by itself.

52
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:36,102
What do you think?

53
00:02:36,136 --> 00:02:38,627
- Fine, I'll just wait.
- Okay, little advice?

54
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:41,232
- Yeah?
- Whatever happened,

55
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:42,832
stay away from that
for a couple of days.

56
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:45,709
Don't worry. I'll be staying away
from it for a while.

57
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:47,736
Very good.
All right, always good to see you.

58
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:49,578
- All right, good to see you.
- All right.

59
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:52,210
- Rock on.
- All right.

60
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:54,379
- Okay? All right.
- Okay, thank you.

61
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:58,786
How did your
doctor's appointment go?

62
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:01,817
I got about another two days
with this thing.

63
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:05,161
He looked at it and says
it will go away by itself.

64
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:08,531
Listen, Larry, we have a lot to do
before my parents get here.

65
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:10,866
What?
What's there to do?

66
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:12,769
We need to do
all their Christmas shopping,

67
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:15,502
and we need to get a Christmas tree.
We've got to get...

68
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,510
Hold it,
hold it, hold it.

69
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:20,638
What are you saying?
Christmas tree?

70
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,205
Yeah, we're gonna
pick out a Christmas tree

71
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,218
and have it set up.

72
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:27,049
We're getting
a Christmas tree?

73
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:29,988
My parents are coming.
We're celebrating Christmas.

74
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:31,581
Is that
a surprise to you?

75
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,855
Give me a break on the tree.
Do we have to do that?

76
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:37,261
Of course we do.
It's Christmas.

77
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,765
It's too weird, man.
Come on, that is just too weird.

78
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,562
No, listen, man,
you're gonna like it.

79
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:43,228
I'm a Jew. To have a tree in the house,
it's bad luck.

80
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,295
You know,
my guy might not...

81
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:47,499
may think I'm switching or something.
He might not understand.

82
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,032
I think your guy is gonna be
fine with it. Don't you want my...

83
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:57,144
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:57,183 --> 00:04:01,176
Did you tip anybody yet
for Christmas?

85
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:03,086
- No, no.
- Huh?

86
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:05,455
- You're gonna take care of that?
- I'll take care of that.

87
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:08,017
Then I got to go get Jeff,
we're gonna go to the club

88
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:11,690
and tip everybody there.
There's no end to it with this holiday.

89
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:13,995
But you know what?
It's gonna make you feel good.

90
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:17,993
All right,
I'll see you later, okay?

91
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:19,505
What should I give...
ah, you don't know...

92
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:26,668
Hey, Dora?

93
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,708
Could you do me
a favor, okay?

94
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,844
When people
call and ask for me,

95
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:37,448
could you please
just not tell them where I am?

96
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:41,823
- Okay.
- Even the doctor's office called up,

97
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:45,456
and you told them
I went to a U2 concert, you know?

98
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:47,523
Mm-hmm.

99
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:50,001
I don't like people
knowing where I go.

100
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:52,163
- Okay, okay.
- Just say I'm not home.

101
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,139
- "Not home."
- Okay, can you do that?

102
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:56,039
- Not home.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:59,807
- Mr. Larry not home. Okay, okay.
- Yes, exactly. Thank you.

104
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:03,744
And here's
a little...

105
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:06,411
little Christmas
thing for you.

106
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:08,444
Oh, okay.

107
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,616
- Here you go.
- Gracias.

108
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:18,188
- Merry Christmas to you.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Larry, thank you.

109
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,629
- All right.
- You enjoy.

110
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:25,331
You too.

111
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:27,863
Bye-bye, Mr. Larry.

112
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:35,746
- Oh, Carlos.
- Oh, Señor Larry.

113
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:37,773
How's the gardening?

114
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,751
- Oh, it's good.
- Gardening's good?

115
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,777
- Gardening's good.
- It's good gardening, isn't it?

116
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:44,119
- It's good gardening.
- Yeah, it's good.

117
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:47,957
- Oh, gardening good, sí.
- Yeah. Carlos,

118
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:50,986
I have a little something
for you for Christmas.

119
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,328
- Feliz navidad.
- Gracias.

120
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:58,235
Usted eres muy amable.
Very kind.

121
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,205
You know what?

122
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,299
You can use
the "tú" form with me.

123
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:04,970
- "Tú"?
- "Usted's" a little formal for us.

124
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:07,605
- Why don't we use the "tú" form?
- Gracias, jefe, gracias.

125
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,342
- Is that okay?
- Oh, sí.

126
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:12,749
Informal "tú", between us,
we don't need "usted."

127
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,344
Tú, yo.

128
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:17,686
- Feliz navidad.
- Feliz navidad... a tú.

129
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,761
Hey.

130
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:30,235
So I heard that you
were at the...

131
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,397
U2 concert.

132
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:36,968
My wife dragged me to the concert.
So big deal.

133
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,069
Do you know anyone
in the band?

134
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:40,807
Well, yeah, I know
the lead singer.

135
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:42,337
- What's his name?
- I know his name.

136
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:44,543
- You don't know his name.
- Hey, asshole, I know his name.

137
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:46,211
- You don't know his name.
- Do you want to bet?

138
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:49,847
- 100 bucks.
- Okay, his name's B-o-n-o.

139
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,618
You got to
pronounce it.

140
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,455
I don't know how
to pronounce it.

141
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:55,859
I don't know if it's "Sonny Bo-no,"
or Bon-no.

142
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:58,625
It's Bon-no.
But, you know what?

143
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:01,498
Because you spelled it, it's a draw.
I don't owe you anything.

144
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:03,434
- Even, okay?
- Who told you, by the way?

145
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,994
Dora.

146
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:07,973
I called the house
and she told me.

147
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:10,134
That is unbelievable.
I just spoke to her about that.

148
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:13,009
My doctor knows,
now you know.

149
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:14,513
She told the doctor
the same thing.

150
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:18,381
Well, you need
to talk with your maid.

151
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:21,410
Well, if you come over my house
in a couple of days,

152
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:22,978
you'll see a
Christmas tree there.

153
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:24,546
Why?

154
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,718
Cheryl's parents are coming.
She wants a tree.

155
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,785
- It's not gonna end there.
- I've never had a tree in my life.

156
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:31,729
- It's a little unsettling, you know?
- It's unsettling.

157
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:33,699
Nothing worse
than Jews with trees.

158
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,167
- At least your wife's not Jewish.
- My wife's not Jewish, yeah.

159
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:38,067
- But those couples?
- Two Jews getting trees?

160
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:39,435
They can't let them
have their holiday.

161
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:41,531
We have to horn in
on their holiday.

162
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:43,974
- Do we have to get in on it?
- It makes me crazy. Yeah.

163
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,875
They can't just let them
have their holiday.

164
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:49,040
Listen to me, listen to me.
Susie's on her way up right now, okay?

165
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:50,913
A couple weeks ago,
she went out of town,

166
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,919
I made a phone call
about 2:00 in the morning,

167
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:57,184
to a friend, woman... platonic.
Okay? Nothing going on.

168
00:07:57,223 --> 00:08:00,920
But she found the phone bill.
I told her it was you, okay?

169
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,894
I said you got
in a fight with Cheryl,

170
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:05,727
you slept over, and then you made
the phone call, okay?

171
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:08,825
- Wow, what a wild story.
- I don't think it's that bad.

172
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:10,836
- It's good.
- It's pretty good.

173
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,428
- I do think it's good.
- Well, thank you.

174
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:14,906
How come you didn't
tell her the truth?

175
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:17,535
Hey, 10 p.m. is the cut-off
for platonic friends.

176
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:20,205
After 10 p.m.,
it gets weird.

177
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:22,646
Hi honey. Oh, Larry,
I didn't know you were here.

178
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:25,082
- I forgot you were coming.
- How are you, sweetheart?

179
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:26,949
- What a surprise.
- Good to see you.

180
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:29,045
- It's so great when you come.
- Aw, here's the keys.

181
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:31,852
- Thank you.
- So...

182
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:34,820
What the fuck
is your problem?

183
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:36,453
What's the matter with him?
What are you doing?

184
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:39,294
No, no, I got something
stuck in my throat.

185
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:41,197
Have some water.

186
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:43,293
Hey, by the way,
do I owe you any money

187
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:45,861
for some of those phone calls
that I made last...

188
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:49,534
Oh, no. You were in a bad place,
it's my pleasure.

189
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,010
- I know I ran up a bill.
- It's my pleasure.

190
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,445
Who are you calling at 2:00 a.m.
from my house, Larry?

191
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,947
What was that about?

192
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:58,473
I was calling
my housekeeper Dora.

193
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:01,180
Wait a minute.
You have a fight with Cheryl,

194
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:04,884
you sleep at my house, and at 2:00 a.m.
you call your housekeeper?

195
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:06,448
Yeah. She was gonna quit,
it was a whole huge thing.

196
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:08,050
She's having big problems
with Cheryl.

197
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:11,257
Cheryl can't find anything.
She couldn't find her pajamas.

198
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:14,289
She yelled at her. She was gonna quit...
I had to talk her out of quitting.

199
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:15,926
At 2:00 in the morning,
Larry?

200
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:18,130
She was quitting the next day.
I had to, yeah.

201
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:20,537
You're lying,
or you're lying.

202
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:23,542
One of you two assholes
is lying, I just don't know which one.

203
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:26,238
- We're not lying.
- Yeah, you are.

204
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,440
- No, we're not.
- No, we're not.

205
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:31,041
I don't believe you.

206
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,279
- It's true.
- It's true.

207
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:35,719
Please, I have things
to do, okay?

208
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,627
All right, let's go to the club
and do some tipping.

209
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:48,557
Merry Christmas.

210
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:52,059
A merry Christmas to you, my friend.
Thank you for everything.

211
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:53,572
Merry Christmas.

212
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,611
Thank you.
Very nice.

213
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:10,784
Merry Christmas.

214
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,253
- That was great.
- How'd you do?

215
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:17,820
Oh, beautiful.
It felt good, they're all happy.

216
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:19,991
What's the matter?

217
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:25,836
Did...
did I tip him...?

218
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,636
I think I tipped
that guy twice.

219
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:30,939
- No.
- Yeah.

220
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:33,002
No, that's ridiculous,
he would've said something.

221
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:35,105
I'm not sure about that.
You know what?

222
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:36,775
I was just going around
tipping everybody,

223
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:38,784
And I got...

224
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:43,121
- I tipped him twice.
- Really?

225
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:45,283
Yeah, 'cause
I got confused.

226
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:46,952
Why wouldn't he say
something to you?

227
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:49,120
'Cause he makes twice as much money.
What do you mean, why?

228
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:50,993
Well, it's just...
you know...

229
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:55,091
Hi.
It's a little awkward,

230
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:59,036
but, you know, I was going around
giving out my Christmas...

231
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:02,007
Yeah, well, that was very nice.
Thank you so much.

232
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,477
You're very welcome,
but I'm sure

233
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:07,342
you're not
aware of this,

234
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,317
but I think I inadvertently
tipped you twice.

235
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:14,320
Twice?
No, no, you came up

236
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:15,719
and you said
"Merry Christmas,"

237
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:18,383
and you gave me some money,
which was very nice,

238
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:21,552
- and then you walked on.
- Yeah, and I did that twice.

239
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:24,791
- No, no, you did it once.
- Well...

240
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:26,890
it was twice.

241
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,127
I'm sure you
didn't realize it.

242
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,432
No, I would have realized it,
if it had happened.

243
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:33,962
But since
it didn't happen...

244
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:37,408
So you're saying
I only tipped you once?

245
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:40,344
Yes.

246
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,871
Do you want your
first tip back?

247
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:45,907
- No, Um-mm.
- Okay.

248
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:49,479
I'd like
my second tip back.

249
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:52,184
There was
no second tip.

250
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:54,557
Hmm.

251
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:11,407
A big gold ball there...

252
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:16,777
- Here, yeah
- That's perfect.

253
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,215
You've got your gold triangle.

254
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:21,414
I'm gonna put this one
right in here... Larry, hi.

255
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:23,649
- Hi, Larry.
- Look, Merry Christmas.

256
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:26,522
You're here.
What do you think, you like it?

257
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,789
- It's kind of big, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's a big one.

258
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:31,797
- Grab a ball.
- Just make a hook. I'll show you.

259
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:34,595
- Make a hook.
- No, maybe later.

260
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:36,602
It's like, the biggest thing
I've ever seen.

261
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:40,197
The bigger the better.

262
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,797
Cheryl's in the kitchen,
by the way, with Becky.

263
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:44,332
Yeah, they're baking.
They're baking cookies.

264
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,709
Oh, how wonderful.

265
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:48,304
So did you finish
your Christmas shopping yet?

266
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:51,145
No, not quite.
Soon.

267
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:54,585
What'd you get Cheryl?
You can tell me.

268
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,647
You know what? I think I'm gonna
give her my grandfather's tallis.

269
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:01,592
- Tallis, what's a tallis?
- I don't know that.

270
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:04,391
- It's like a scarf.
- Oh, he's getting her a scarf.

271
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,590
She loves scarves.
Is that all?

272
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:07,895
Yeah.

273
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,194
Got something
caught in your throat?

274
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,899
Grape stem.

275
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:17,933
Oh.

276
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:19,740
Oh, yeah.

277
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,371
Well, here,
have some...

278
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:24,212
That's okay.

279
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:27,909
Oh, this doesn't
have a hook.

280
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:29,285
- Hi, Becky.
- How are you?

281
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:31,017
- Good.
- Happy holidays.

282
00:13:31,057 --> 00:13:32,285
- Happy holidays.
- How are you?

283
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:35,453
- Okay.
- Hello, darling.

284
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:37,463
Honey, why can't you
wear the scarf

285
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:39,192
that Dora gave you
for your birthday?

286
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,200
You know,
the red one?

287
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:43,566
Because it itches me.
It's itchy.

288
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:45,901
Well, she brought it
up to me today.

289
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:48,429
She just feels
like you don't care

290
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:50,738
that she gave you
this lovely present.

291
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,173
Then she told me
that you yelled at her

292
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:59,275
for telling people
where you go.

293
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:00,808
I didn't yell at her,
we had a talk,

294
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:05,051
because my doctor had heard
that I went to the U2 concert.

295
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:08,853
You went
to the U2 concert?

296
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,092
She dragged me to the concert.
So I went, what's the big deal?

297
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:14,429
Okay. And listen,
she's upset

298
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:17,129
because you tipped Carlos
twice as much as you tipped her.

299
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,434
What, are you crazy?
I didn't do that.

300
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:21,440
- You tipped our gardener twice.
- That's really in poor form.

301
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:24,170
- You can't do that.
- He's lying, like the waiter.

302
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,041
- At the club.
- What waiter?

303
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,241
I gave the waiter a tip twice,
'cause I didn't remember...

304
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:32,217
- Why are you doing that?
- I was going around tipping everybody.

305
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:34,378
I didn't know who to tip and who not.
I forgot who I tipped,

306
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,911
- so I tipped him twice.
- You know what you should do?

307
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,753
You should take her
to lunch at the club.

308
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,985
That is a really
good idea.

309
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:42,153
Treat her to a very nice lunch.

310
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:44,629
Everything she says
you go along with?

311
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:47,189
I would like it if you took me
to lunch is all I'm saying.

312
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:48,666
You can disagree
with her once.

313
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:50,601
She happens to think
that I'm right most of the time.

314
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:53,196
Do you really think
I should take her to lunch?

315
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:56,868
Oh, honey,
it would mean so much to her.

316
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:59,343
Okay.
I'll take her to lunch.

317
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:02,040
I think
that's wonderful.

318
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:04,049
- Nice tree, by the way.
- Thank you.

319
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:12,747
- Carlos.
- Oh, Señor Larry.

320
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:16,421
Carlos, let me ask you something.
Did you tell Dora

321
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:20,899
that you got a bigger
Christmas bonus than her?

322
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,231
No.

323
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:27,228
'Cause she told my wife
that you said that.

324
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:30,003
No, señor.

325
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:33,843
Why would she make up
something like that?

326
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:37,315
No sé.

327
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,217
Don't you
find that curious?

328
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:42,778
No, señor.

329
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:19,391
You know
what I love?

330
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,417
I love
how you know

331
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:24,554
when we're gonna
run out of soy milk.

332
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:27,031
You anticipate it, and then
you put a new one in the refrigerator,

333
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:29,159
so there's always
a cold one in there.

334
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:32,466
- I notice that.
- Okay, Mr. Larry.

335
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:38,310
You're a good folder.

336
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:40,141
Very good folder.

337
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:42,272
Particularly
with the t-shirts.

338
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:44,442
There's a little kind of thing
you do at the end...

339
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:45,950
you flip them over,

340
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:48,317
the arms, they get,
like, flipped over

341
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:52,222
like a little penguin.

342
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:53,384
Okay.

343
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:56,293
I see that,
I notice the folding.

344
00:16:57,296 --> 00:16:59,264
The toilet paper...

345
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:02,665
Okay, let's discuss
the toilet paper.

346
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:06,900
I am never in that bathroom
looking at cardboard.

347
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:10,102
As soon as it runs out,
you've got the new roll.

348
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:12,610
I'm never
running out of there

349
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,078
with my pants at my ankles
screaming, "More toilet paper!"

350
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:17,446
You know?
What else, what else do you do?

351
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:19,917
Toilet paper...

352
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:22,819
folding...

353
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:24,948
soy milk.

354
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,927
Your sponge replacement's
not so hot...

355
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:30,792
if I can speak frankly.

356
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,663
Okay, Mr. Larry.

357
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:38,127
- Finished?
- No, no.

358
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,161
Okay.

359
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:42,606
Señorita, algo más?

360
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:45,405
No, gracias.
Muy amable.

361
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:47,503
Oye, ¿ qué haces
con el viejo este, eh?

362
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:49,844
Pues ahí trabajo
en su casa, fíjense.

363
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,713
- Ay, qué pena.
- No me pagan mucho.

364
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,981
No, claro que no.
Mira, si te regala algo,

365
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:58,217
- dale un recibo.
- ¿ Sí?

366
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:03,995
What was...
what was that all about?

367
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:07,558
Christmas.

368
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:17,202
- Hi.
- Hi. Greene.

369
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,040
- Hey.
- Hey!

370
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:21,603
Oh, Larry's here.
Hi, Lar.

371
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,047
- Looky, looky.
- Hey, hi, Sammy.

372
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,641
Hi, Larry.

373
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:27,242
- Susie.
- Hi.

374
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:30,016
I'd like you to meet Dora,
my housekeeper.

375
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:31,716
- Hello.
- This is your housekeeper, Dora?

376
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:34,453
Oh, all right,
all right, look.

377
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:37,462
All right. I made a mistake,
I'm sorry, I apologize.

378
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:41,660
- You sure did.
- I apologize profusely to both of you.

379
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,827
Maybe next time
you won't jump down my throat.

380
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:46,770
- I was thinking crazy things.
- You insulted me, my friend...

381
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,774
I know, but I thought
you were talking to a woman.

382
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:52,403
- Larry, I'm so sorry.
- Frankly, I was pretty insulted.

383
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:55,676
- Jeff.
- Hey, Chris, how you doing?

384
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:57,409
- Pretty darn good.
- Good to see you.

385
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,045
- Larry.
- Christopher. Where's that 20 bucks?

386
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:03,111
- Oh, God, you're right.
- You seem like such a lovely woman.

387
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:05,146
I don't know why
Cheryl doesn't like you.

388
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:06,954
I'm sure it has nothing to do
with your work.

389
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:08,823
I'm sure your work is terrific,
'cause I've seen the house...

390
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:10,795
Is this the best
coincidence?

391
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,923
- What are the odds?
- I know, what are the odds?

392
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:15,195
What are the odds? This is unbelievable.
I can't believe it.

393
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:16,963
You are hungry?
We'll get Daddy.

394
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:19,368
- Honey, Sammy's hungry.
- Okay, let's go.

395
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:22,568
- Good, come on, Sammy.
- And Lar, again...

396
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:24,735
I apologize.

397
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:27,905
- We all make mistakes.
- I know.

398
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:33,842
Something wrong?

399
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:38,985
Is it the sponge thing?

400
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:42,892
O come, all ye faithful

401
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:46,420
Joyful and triumphant

402
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:50,265
O come ye,
O come ye

403
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:54,204
To Bethlehem

404
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,903
Come and behold Him

405
00:19:57,943 --> 00:20:01,435
Born the king
of angels

406
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,574
O come let us
adore Him

407
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:08,075
O come
let us adore Him

408
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,578
O come
let us adore Him

409
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:15,082
Christ the Lord

410
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:18,255
Yea Lord,
we greet Thee

411
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:21,323
Born
this happy morning

412
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,892
Jesus to Thee
be all glory...

413
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:28,066
- Come on.
- Hey, Larry, join us.

414
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:30,041
- I don't think so. Thank you.
- The words are right here.

415
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:32,839
We got them off the Internet, Larry.
They're a little different.

416
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:35,073
How much longer do you think
the caroling's gonna go on tonight?

417
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:38,582
- Whenever.
- We don't know.

418
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:44,685
Larry, can I see you
for a second?

419
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:46,315
Sure.

420
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:51,787
O come
let us adore Him

421
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,422
O come let us
adore Him...

422
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,231
- What's up?
- Well, Dora quit.

423
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:59,965
- What?
- Yeah, I asked her why,

424
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:03,441
and she said Susie Greene
told her that I don't like her.

425
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:05,443
So I just
talked to Susie,

426
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:08,935
- To find out what exactly was going on.
- Oh, for God's sake...

427
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:11,449
Susie tells me
this story

428
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:14,475
about us getting
in a fight...

429
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,988
and you're spending
the night over there,

430
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:19,081
and you're
calling Dora.

431
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:22,719
And I told Susie
that you and Jeff are full of shit.

432
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:27,529
The little Lord Jesus

433
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:30,558
Laid down
His sweet head

434
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:33,595
The stars
in the sky

435
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:36,631
Looked down
where He lay

436
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:40,008
The little
Lord Jesus

437
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:43,879
Asleep in the hay.

438
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,111
Larry!

439
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:52,282
- Larry!
- What?

440
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:58,494
- What?
- What happened to the cookies?

441
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,090
- What?
- The cookies!

442
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:03,601
The cookies
from last night?

443
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:05,467
- Yeah.
- What? I ate them.

444
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:07,938
What?
You ate them?

445
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:10,066
They were for
the manger scene.

446
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:12,475
You ate the baby Jesus
and his mother Mary.

447
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:14,775
- I thought they were animal cookies.
- Animal cookies?

448
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:17,873
- Are you kidding?
- Jesus Christ is not an animal!

449
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,781
I thought
he was a monkey.

450
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:21,786
- A monkey?
- Oh, please!

451
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:26,484
- The Son of God was a monkey?
- We worked all day on those cookies.

452
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:29,016
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't see the "hay"?

453
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:31,723
The toasted coconut was hay.
The barn?

454
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:34,130
I thought that was
all part of the zoo.

455
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:37,567
Why would we have a zoo
on Christmas Day?! Okay...

456
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:40,071
You know what?
I'll make it up to you.

457
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:41,800
How are you gonna
make it up to us?

458
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,070
- You swallowed our Lord and Savior.
- I'll make it up.

459
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:45,736
- I'll get another manger scene.
- Yeah? Where?

460
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:49,373
Nothing's open.
It's Christmas.

461
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:51,906
Okay, we're going
to go visit our cousin.

462
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,679
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

463
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,516
I'm sorry,
I'll make it up to you.

464
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:58,148
Oh my God.

465
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,291
You'd better
look into that.

466
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:12,566
You lying piece of shit!
Out of my house!

467
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:14,629
- Why?
- Out of my house!

468
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:16,698
- I didn't lie.
- Oh, you lied.

469
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:18,710
- I didn't lie!
- And wait till I get my hands

470
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:21,679
on that goddamn Larry David,
the four-eyed fuck.

471
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:23,875
I'll kill him!

472
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:43,093
We are humble,
simple people.

473
00:23:43,135 --> 00:23:45,126
I know you
have traveled far.

474
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:50,898
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?

475
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:55,672
- Just continue.
- How you doing?

476
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:57,909
Hello.

477
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,078
Hi.
Let me ask you a question.

478
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,850
How can I go about...

479
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:05,720
renting one of these
manger groups?

480
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:10,422
Renting? We're a volunteer group
with the church.

481
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:13,556
- So...
- I'm kind of in a bind.

482
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,366
It's Christmas Day,
we have no manger scene.

483
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:20,928
- Is it a manger scene?
- A Nativity, certainly.

484
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:24,170
We don't have a Nativity scene
in my house. We had one, but I ate it.

485
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:26,234
There were cookies, and...

486
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:28,303
is there any way
that I could,

487
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:30,611
get your group
to go to my house?

488
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:33,482
- Today?
- Yes.

489
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,044
- Oh, it's Christmas. Wow.
- Yeah, I know.

490
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:39,023
Just for a couple of hours.
Like, three, four hours.

491
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:42,220
Oh, I see. Well, actually,
we do have a break coming up.

492
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:45,924
We could probably
see our way to your home.

493
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:49,593
You know, obviously we would
work something out.

494
00:24:49,635 --> 00:24:52,570
Oh, great, a donation for the church
would be a capital thing.

495
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:55,402
- Fine, a donation.
- Great, yes.

496
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,908
Okay...

497
00:24:57,943 --> 00:25:00,935
Well, we'd have to
maybe discuss the donation.

498
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:03,880
Whatever you think is fair.
What do you think is fair?

499
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:08,546
Huh, I don't really want to say,
but I guess I'm forced to.

500
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:11,317
$500.

501
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:16,852
And a meal of course, because
we're about to have a lunch.

502
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:18,658
I don't really cook.
It would have to be take-out, you know.

503
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:20,927
That's fine.

504
00:25:20,966 --> 00:25:24,663
Okay, $500, fine.
I'll give you $500.

505
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:27,399
And the meal.
I don't mean to push.

506
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:29,304
Okay.
Which one are you?

507
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:31,104
- I'm "Joseph."
- Joseph, Larry.

508
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:32,701
- Hello, Larry.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

509
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:35,372
Pleasure.

510
00:25:35,414 --> 00:25:37,712
- So yeah, I just...
- That's "Mary" over there.

511
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:40,547
That would be Mary of course,
the Mother of God.

512
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:46,554
Okay, great.
You can put all this junk on a trailer?

513
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:48,651
It's not junk,
but we do put it in the trailer.

514
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:51,128
It all fits in there.
It's very convenient.

515
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:54,064
Beautiful.
Well, this is fantastic.

516
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:56,829
- Works out for everybody.
- I'm so thrilled about this.

517
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:59,861
I was in a bind, and you
really helped me out, Joseph.

518
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:02,271
I'm glad I could do that.
It's a pleasure.

519
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:05,299
- We'll need directions to your home.
- Yes, of course, yeah.

520
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:21,652
- Find out where we put the manger...
- Joseph?

521
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:23,661
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

522
00:26:23,695 --> 00:26:25,560
Boy, that was fast.

523
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:27,792
Yes, well, the excellent
directions didn't hurt.

524
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,460
- That always helps, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

525
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:32,664
Look at that. You packed that manger
in five minutes and you're off.

526
00:26:32,704 --> 00:26:35,172
Yeah, we all have an assigned job,
we pitch in.

527
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:37,368
Too bad you don't have
this Christmas all year round, huh?

528
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:39,172
You'd make a
pretty good living.

529
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:41,771
Actually we do
a Passion Play on Easter.

530
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:45,977
And around 4th of July we do
hobo revolutionaries.

531
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:50,284
And sometimes
in November we'll do an equinox.

532
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:53,485
Okay. I thought
we would...

533
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:55,652
set up around here,
in this area.

534
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:57,389
Excellent choice.
I was thinking the same myself.

535
00:26:57,429 --> 00:26:58,521
- Does that work for you?
- Yes, sir.

536
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:00,793
Okay, beautiful.

537
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:03,198
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

538
00:27:03,235 --> 00:27:06,636
- Oh, look at the little baby.
- Yes. We've all arrived.

539
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:08,663
All right, you got little Jesus
and the whole troupe.

540
00:27:08,707 --> 00:27:11,175
- All right, very good.
- We'll set right up, in short order.

541
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:13,609
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Very good, sir, thank you.

542
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:15,613
Okay.

543
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,582
A nice man, good host.
All right, let's get to it, then.

544
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:41,700
This is fantastic.
Look at this.

545
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,935
- This is great, I love this.
- Thank you.

546
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:47,776
They're gonna be so thrilled
when they come home.

547
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:50,646
Thank you, Joseph.
Thank you, Mary,

548
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:52,513
shepherds...

549
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,678
- It's our pleasure.
- Joseph, let me ask you something.

550
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,348
Yes.

551
00:27:57,389 --> 00:27:59,823
You mentioned something about
some interest in food a little earlier.

552
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:02,258
We did talk
about a meal, yes.

553
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:05,127
You want me to get a take-out thing
for you happening?

554
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:08,291
- That's fine.
- Chinese, deli? What do you like, Joey?

555
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:11,063
- Yes, yes.
- Yes to both?

556
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:12,331
- Yes to both.
- You want both?

557
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:14,601
That would be fantastic,
thank you.

558
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:17,233
I guess you build a big appetite
standing out here doing nothing, huh?

559
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:19,505
- More than you'd think, yes.
- Huh, interesting.

560
00:28:19,544 --> 00:28:22,138
All right, I'll get you
a little orange chicken?

561
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,978
- Oh, yeah, sounds wonderful.
- Does that sound good?

562
00:28:25,017 --> 00:28:27,076
But you got to be careful.
They got a lot of hot peppers in there.

563
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:29,553
- Don't eat the peppers.
- I like the peppers.

564
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:31,385
- You like the peppers?
- I have the tongue for it, yes.

565
00:28:31,423 --> 00:28:34,415
- Joseph likes the peppers.
- Yes, I do. I confess.

566
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:37,587
All right, very good.
Hey, Joseph, let me ask you a question.

567
00:28:40,332 --> 00:28:42,061
Are you okay?

568
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,365
I got a pubic hair
stuck in my throat.

569
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:47,599
Oh... that's
unfortunate.

570
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:50,233
I can't get rid of this thing.
It's killing me.

571
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:53,574
It's driving me nuts, Joseph.
Driving me nuts.

572
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:55,944
I'm not interested
in your personal...

573
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:59,075
Oh, boy. That Mary,
by the way, has quite the bod.

574
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,244
What?

575
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:03,220
Come on, Joey,
between you and me...

576
00:29:03,255 --> 00:29:06,349
you and Mary? You don't feel like it
every now and then?

577
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,859
- What do you do?
- No. You know what? We're leaving.

578
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:10,862
That's it, let's pack it up.
We're leaving!

579
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:13,057
- What? Come on, Joe.
- I'm not going to stand for this!

580
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:15,692
Don't "Joe" me, we're leaving.
You will take it back.

581
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:17,565
- Get your hands off me!
- You stand right here and take it back!

582
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:20,400
- Gentlemen, please!
- Take it back!

583
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:22,464
- Kill him, Joseph, kill him!
- Shut up, Mary!

584
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:24,771
Get off me!

585
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,370
Wait a second.

586
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:35,880
The pubic hair.

587
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:39,049
It's out!
