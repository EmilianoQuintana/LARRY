Episode 5x10: The End

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,900
It's kind of small in there.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,900
Yeah, but it's not for you it's for your nanny, right?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,500
It's for my nanny. You're right.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,200
All right, how much?

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,700
Whatever you think is fair.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,200
I'm shocked.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,200
All right, um, you know what?

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,400
I'll find the blue book value and that's what I'll give you.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,604
- You got a deal, my big friend.
- All right, my friend.

12
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:31,702
- All right.
- Good.

13
00:00:31,702 --> 00:00:32,800
- Oh my gosh!
- Congratulations.

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,600
- You bought yourself a great car.
- Oh, hold on a second.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,100
Louis Lewis has just come out of his coma.

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,700
Okay, so what happens now?

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,400
Oh yeah, oh that's a great idea.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,100
Yeah, no, invite anybody you want.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,500
Yeah, let's go all the way.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,900
Okay, I'll see you tonight. All right, bye.

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,900
I'm going to a party tonight

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,600
my friends are throwing for me 'cause I'm getting out of here,

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,600
and I would like you to go with me.
- Okay.

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,700
- Yes?
- Yeah.

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,700
Wow.

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Hey, what are you gonna do about your cousin who needs a kidney?

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,900
- What, Ritchie?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,500
Well, so we'll find him a kidney.

29
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,100
- What about yours?
- What, are you crazy?

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,100
I'm not giving anybody my kidney. I just woke up.

31
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm gonna give things out now?

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,100
- That's very selfish.
- Selfish?

33
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,500
- Yeah.
- Hey, let me ask you a question.

34
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,100
You know, I heard that you come in and out of here all the time

35
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,900
and I don't understand that.

36
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,400
I hardly know you.

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,400
I met you briefly once at Ritchie's house and

38
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,500
they tell me you're in here all the time.

39
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,800
I visit people in the hospital

40
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,800
and I cheer them up. I go around, I do volunteer work.

41
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,200
And I knew you were here so I stopped in to see you.

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,900
Well I'll tell you something, you don't have to cheer me up

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,900
because I'm cheered up.

44
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,600
It pays to be in a coma, I'm telling you.

45
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,800
I've never felt so refreshed in my life.

46
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,700
- Oh, really?
- You know those bears, they had it right.

47
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,100
They go into hibernation, they come out like new bears.

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Everybody should do this.

49
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,800
Congratulations again on the...

50
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,300
getting out of the coma.

51
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,900
You should've seen him walking down that hall.

52
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,300
It was like the specter of death.

53
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,300
And then he passed me and he looked at me.

54
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
I'm haunted by that look.

55
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,300
Have you seen the, uh, case for the Soprano's DVD?

56
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
No.

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,900
I can't find it anywhere.

58
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,500
Did you do something with it?

59
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,000
No, I didn't do anything with it.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If you're blaming this on me, you're barking up the wrong tree, okay?

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I have a system.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,800
When I watch a DVD, I put the case on top of the DVD player.

63
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,500
Then when I'm done, I take the DVD,

64
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,300
I put it back in the case, and then I put it back on the shelf.

65
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,200
Well, your system's breaking down.

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,500
- My system is foolproof.
- There's no case on top of the DVD player.

67
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Well, you're the one, probably, who took it out and didn't put it back.

68
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Don't blame it on me.

69
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,800
I mean, I'm not even that friendly with him.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,500
Yeah, I know him 44 years, but we're not really close friends.

71
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
He's more of an acquaintance.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,300
Who gives a kidney to an acquaintance?

73
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,300
I just feel like if we're going to watch DVD's

74
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,900
that we should keep the case nearby

75
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,300
so we don't end up with just the...

76
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you have any sympathy at all for what I'm going through?

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It doesn't seem like you do. Okay?

78
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,100
Hello?

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Oh, okay, um,

80
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,400
yeah, all right, I'll... I'll see you tomorrow.

81
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,400
All right, thanks.

82
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,600
- Huh.
- What?

83
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
That was Omar Jones.

84
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,200
He said he has some information for me.

85
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,700
He wants me to come to the office tomorrow.

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,700
So, Mr. David, I've got some very very interesting news

87
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,300
for you about your case.

88
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,800
Turns out you were right.

89
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,900
You are, in fact, adopted.

90
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,700
Now your biological parents are Mr. And Mrs. Cone,

91
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,900
and they currently reside in Bisbee, Arizona.

92
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,700
They're awaiting your call.

93
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,700
<i>Please notice this aircraft has three emergency exits</i>

94
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,400
<i>located in the rear, center and forward sections of the cabin.</i>

95
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,300
<i>Passengers seated in these...</i>

96
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,900
Hi. Um, listen,

97
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,700
I can't really sit here by the emergency door exit.

98
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,100
I think you better get someone else.

99
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
Okay, Sir we're about three minutes away from wheels up.

100
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,300
So you need to just stay put, okay? 'Cause we got a full plane.

101
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,700
You don't understand. If something happens we won't be able to get out.

102
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,700
- Calm down, okay?
- I cannot do it. I will panic.

103
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,100
We will go down.

104
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,500
All we need to know is that you're willing to assist passengers

105
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,000
in the event of a non-traditional landing.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,900
I cannot be of any help whatsoever

107
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,300
in any kind of non-traditional landing or any traditional landing.

108
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,200
- Did you read the brochure?
- Read the brochure?

109
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,100
I can't read that brochure. It's Chinese to me.

110
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm sorry, are you Chinese?

111
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,500
You look a little Asian. I'm sorry.

112
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,100
It's just an expression.

113
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,300
I don't think you are Chinese. You look maybe Thai?

114
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,900
Is it the seat or are you just scared to fly?

115
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,800
No, I choke under pressure. In any kind of game...

116
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,500
basketball, if I was on the foul line towards,

117
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,100
like the last five minutes of the game, I would miss the entire rim.

118
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,500
I couldn't even hit the rim!

119
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,800
'Cause I was choking.

120
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,600
Choking.

121
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,700
Sir, how about I get you a drink? Would you like a Merlot?

122
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,400
No thank you, I don't drink. I don't drink.

123
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Just please find somebody else to sit here.

124
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,400
I'll look for a seat for you but you owe me one, Mister.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,500
Thank you.

126
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,000
I mean, it's ridiculous. I don't want to sit here.

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,300
Why is she giving me a hard time? Just find somebody else.

128
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,700
Who the hell knows how to do this thing?

129
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,900
What, pull down? What is that gonna do?

130
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,600
Can I pull down? Do you have to be strong? I don't even know.

131
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,500
Then what do you do? You smash this thing?

132
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,500
What happens then? The door just suddenly opens miraculously?

133
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,500
You're not Chinese. You don't look Chinese.

134
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,700
What are you, Thai? I think you're thai. You're thai?

135
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,200
I knew it.

136
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
- Son.
- Dad.

137
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,600
Gosh. Come on in.

138
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Well, I had just come out of the navy and, uh...

139
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,500
- just gotten out, yeah.
- That's right, we met in Times Square and

140
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
she was the prettiest girl there so I kissed her.

141
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,100
And, before long,

142
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,900
we had a baby.

143
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,900
But, we didn't have any money and...

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,804
well, we just didn't know what to do.

145
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:42,602
We were just so young and just...

146
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:44,000
- I understand.
- You know?

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You remember anything about the people who you,

148
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,500
what, adopted me?
- Who adopted you? Yeah, we met them.

149
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,400
The guy was a little nervous and jumpy.

150
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,200
He was all over the place. Jumpy, fidgety.

151
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Fidgety guy?

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,100
Kind of talked like that a little bit?

153
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,800
He did kind of.

154
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,100
- That's exactly right.
- He really has it, doesn't he?

155
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,500
I remember that, yeah.

156
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,500
And she was lovely, but she was a little loud.

157
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,400
But she... she sort of ruled the roost.

158
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,300
- Oh yeah.
- But you knew she was a good woman.

159
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,900
You wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of her, though.

160
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,700
- No, you wouldn't.
- Yeah.

161
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,700
And they... they wanted a baby so badly.

162
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,300
Tell me a little bit about where you're from, Brooklyn?

163
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,600
Oh, no no no. I'm from Illinois.

164
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,400
Yeah, and I'm from Virginia.

165
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,000
- I was born and raised in Virginia.
- There, yeah.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So, so we're both sort of midwestern, southern.

167
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,000
My people came from,

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,900
oh, England and Scotland.

169
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,200
Been here for hundreds of years.

170
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,700
How do you spell your last name?

171
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,100
C-o-n-e.

172
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,900
Oh my god.

173
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm gentile.

174
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,200
Hey look, Dave. Hi Dave, how you doing?

175
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,400
I want you to meet our son. This is Larry.

176
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,000
- Larry, nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you, Dave.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,800
- How are you today?
- He's a Chevrolet dealer here.

178
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,500
How come my dad bought one of those?

179
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,500
- I don't know, I can't help that.
- I'm in trouble.

180
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,800
- Hi, June.
- Hi, Jenny.

181
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,700
- Good to see you.
- Hi, Jenny.

182
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,600
- This is Larry, our son Larry.
- Larry, nice to meet you.

183
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,400
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Enjoying our town?

184
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,900
Oh, I love it. It's beautiful.

185
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,300
- Hey, hi Wilson.
- Hi.

186
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,400
This is our son Larry.

187
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,100
- Hi, Wilson.
- I didn't know you had a son.

188
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
We do now.

189
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,700
- Are you sticking around?
- I think I might.

190
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,000
- Isn't that nice?
- Nice little town.

191
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,400
You're gonna like it here.

192
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

193
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,100
I noticed you're selling your car here.

194
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,300
Yep, lettin' her go.

195
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,000
You interested?

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,500
Well, no I'm not. But may I ask how you arrived at that price?

197
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,700
Sure, that's the actual blue book value.

198
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,400
- That's the blue book value?
- Yeah, right there.

199
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,900
Huh, I sold a prius to a friend of mine

200
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
and he told me the blue book value was $5,000 less than that.

201
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Ouch.

202
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Larry, what's wrong?

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,300
My friend took advantage of me, mom.

204
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,200
Oh, I know it hurts son,

205
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,000
but you must practice love and forgiveness.

206
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,700
Give him the benefit of the doubt.

207
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,700
That's what Jesus would do.

208
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,400
Hey, I gotta bite, pop.

209
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
I got... I got it. I got one.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,500
You did it!

211
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Good, son.

212
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Chug, chug, chug, chug...

213
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,000
Wow, this really looks yummy.

214
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We have, we have to say grace first, Larry.

215
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,400
Dear Lord, we thank you for this bountiful meal.

216
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,400
We thank you for the love of each other.

217
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,400
And most of all, we thank you for our son, Larry,

218
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,400
that he's able to be with us here today, having this great meal.

219
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,900
Amen.

220
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,400
- Amen.
- Amen.

221
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
- What do you got there?
- Sign of the cross.

222
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,500
Oh, nose, toes...

223
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,200
- nose?
- ... and watch, wallet.

224
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,800
Nose, toes...

225
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,400
except I keep my watch and wallet on the same side.

226
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
- I don't think it's gonna work.
- Oh, Larry.

227
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,700
All right, nose, toes, I'll just move my wallet to the right side.

228
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,500
- That's simple.
- That's it, right?

229
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,300
One, two, three, four. I kind of like that.

230
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Right, that's it. You have it. Yeah.

231
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,900
- That's it?
- That's it. Dig in, Larry.

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,500
All right.

233
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Oh, Larry.

234
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,900
<i>Go, tell it on the mountain</i>

235
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,200
<i>Over the hills and everywhere</i>

236
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,500
<i>Go, tell it on the mountain,</i>

237
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,800
<i>That Jesus Christ is born.</i>

238
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,900
<i>While sheperds kept their watching</i>

239
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,900
<i>O'er silent flocks by night</i>

240
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,500
<i>Behold throughout the heavens<i>

241
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,500
<i>There shone a holy light.<i>

242
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,100
<i>Go, tell it on the mountain</i>

243
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,700
<i>Over the hills and everywhere</i>

244
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,000
<i>Go, tell it on the mountain,</i>

245
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,600
<i>That Jesus Christ is born.</i>

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,600
My friends,

247
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,600
I want to speak to you on this beautiful sunday morning

248
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,300
about a relationship in our lives that we sometimes take for granted.

249
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,000
We have our family.

250
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We have our husbands, wives, children,

251
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
and all the extended relatives of that family.

252
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,900
But there is another bond,

253
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,300
and that is the bond of friendship.

254
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,800
Think of all that it implies.

255
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,000
The caring, the compassion, the devotion to loyalty,

256
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,200
and above all, perhaps, to the generosity of spirit.

257
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
We must all ask ourselves,

258
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,900
am I a good friend?

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,300
Am I giving the friend in need what he needs most?

260
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,000
Have I sacrificed my own well-being for the sake of him,

261
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,600
or have I let my own selfish needs

262
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,000
stand in the way of being his best friend.

263
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,700
My friends...

264
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,700
- Mom, dad.
- give whenever the opportunity arises...

265
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,800
I have to go.

266
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,800
... and taste the joy that is god's reward.

267
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,300
<i>Please notice this aircraft has three emergency exits</i>

268
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,000
<i>located in the rear, center and forward sections of the cabin.</i>

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,800
<i>Passengers seated in these exit rows agree to assist in the event of emergency.</i>

270
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,500
<i>If for any reason a passenger seated in the exit row...</i>

271
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,000
- Well, hello again.
- Oh, hi there.

272
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,400
Hi. I'll go ahead and get you another seat, okay?

273
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,300
Oh, won't hear of it.

274
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,000
You can depend on me, ma'am.

275
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,500
I won't let you down.

276
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,800
- I got it covered.
- Really?

277
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,300
Oh and, uh, be a dear, would you and get me a gin and tonic.

278
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
S ure.

279
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,300
Nice day for flight.

280
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,200
You can have my kidney.

281
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,700
Oh, I love you man. I knew you'd come through. You're a hero.

282
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,500
It's okay buddy. Everything's gonna be okay.

283
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,100
Oh, I hope so. Thank you man.

284
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,400
Oh god.

285
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,700
- Hey?
- Huh?

286
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,000
- What's that?
- What's that what?

287
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,700
- What's this putter?
- Larry, thank you.

288
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,100
Have you always had this?

289
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,900
Yeah, I've had these for a while, you know.

290
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,200
I borrowed this from my friend a few weeks ago

291
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,600
and I played out of my mind with it.

292
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,200
I've been looking all over for this.

293
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,600
You can't even get them anymore.

294
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,800
My god, I love this putter.

295
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,200
Yeah, I know, it's pretty great.

296
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Um, would it be okay if I borrowed this for a while?

297
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Mmm, I don't think so.

298
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,200
What?

299
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,500
I've... I've lost a lot of clubs.

300
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,900
I've lent them out through the years...

301
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,400
I'm not going to do anything. I'll take really good care of it, believe me.

302
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,900
- I can't lend them out anymore.
- I don't get that.

303
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,300
Come on, I'll take good care of it, I promise.

304
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,300
No, I'm sure you will. But I... I prefer you didn't.

305
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,800
I'm... I'm about...

306
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,900
What?

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I completely understand. I... I...

308
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,900
- I respect your decisions.
- Really?

309
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,800
I still love you.

310
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,700
God bless you.

311
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,100
Jesus Christ.

312
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Cheryl?

313
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,900
- Yeah?
- I'm home.

314
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,500
How are you?

315
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,000
Good to see you.

316
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,800
Oh my god.

317
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
What?

318
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
I love you. I love you.

319
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Mmm, I love you so much.

320
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,700
- I love you.
- Okay.

321
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,200
What are you wearing? Is this a sweater vest?

322
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,500
- I've been doing a lot of thinking.
- Hm-mm.

323
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,300
I want to have children.

324
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,600
Lots of them.

325
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,100
Well, let's talk about that.

326
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,100
We... we, uh, that deserves a discussion, I think.

327
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,400
We can talk about it tonight over dinner.

328
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,800
Okay.

329
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,700
And then I'll tell you all about them.

330
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Yeah, maybe you could, uh...

331
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
you know, take your tie off.

332
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,400
I know why God

333
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,400
saved me from drowning a few months ago.

334
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Why?

335
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,100
He wanted me to give Lewis my kidney.

336
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
And I'm going to.

337
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,400
Gotta say, man,

338
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
you are very, very calm, bro.

339
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,500
God will watch over me.

340
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,000
Hmm. He didn't watch over the last guy.

341
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,300
But you're a lucky man.

342
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
You're giving away a kidney.

343
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,300
The recipient is going to love you, man.

344
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,000
- Really?
- You're gonna have your own personal slave,

345
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,200
is what it is. You could be in China and sneeze

346
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,800
and he'll bring you a tissue.

347
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,100
Well, that may be true of others. I don't think with him, though.

348
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,800
He wouldn't even loan me a putter, actually.

349
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,500
You're giving him a kidney, he wouldn't loan you his putter?

350
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,900
Well, you know people get very attached to their golf clubs.

351
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,900
- It's understandable.
- You're not attached to your kidney?

352
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,100
That's fucked up, man.

353
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
Larry, I gotta tell ya,

354
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm too weak to really express it and articulate it,

355
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
but this is the greatest thing that anyone's ever done for me.

356
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
I'll do anything for you for the rest of your life.

357
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Just ask me anything and I'll do it for you, I promise.

358
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,000
Anything except loan him your putter.

359
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
You told him about the putter?

360
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,900
No, it was an innocent conversation.

361
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,100
Why would you even bring it up under the circumstances?

362
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,700
- I actually defended you.
- Mr. David.

363
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,100
Defend me? Why don't you call E.T. or Pat O'Brien?

364
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
- Mr. David!
- I mean, how dare you?

365
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,400
What, you have to gossip? What kind of person are you?

366
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,300
- There's been a big, big mistake, okay?
- Huh?

367
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,300
The Cones, they're not your parents.

368
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,600
You're not adopted.

369
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,300
- What are you talking about?
- You're not adopted.

370
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,700
- I'm not adopted?
- No. Sorry.

371
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
- What's going on here?
- What do you mean I'm not adopted?

372
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,500
- What's going on here?
- If you need anything, just let me know, okay?

373
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,800
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I am.

374
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Good luck with the surgery.

375
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,100
I can't... I can't do this.

376
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,600
Oh, no no! I'm not adopted.

377
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,000
Get me out of here! Get me the fuck out of here!

378
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,100
- Who is that guy?
- I can't do this!

379
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,100
- What the hell are you... stop it!
- What about my kidney?

380
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,500
I got... I don't... I can't die.

381
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Hey, stay here. What are you doing?

382
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,900
You're the best. You're the best.

383
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,000
- Hey.
- Let's go.

384
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,000
You really low-balled me on that car.

385
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,000
You paid me $5,000 less than the blue book.

386
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,900
I looked in the wrong book, I guess, um.

387
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,500
I want you to give the $5,000 to Cher...

388
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,500
to Cheryl.

389
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,000
I'll give the $5,000 to Cheryl.

390
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Okay.

391
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,700
See?

392
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,700
This is what you get from doing good deeds.

393
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,200
I avoided good deeds my whole life.

394
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,700
Turns out I was right.

395
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,400
You're right.

396
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,900
Larry, the rabbi is here.

397
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,400
The rabbi.

398
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,800
Rabbi.

399
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,700
Larry, what can I say?

400
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,900
I'm still young, Rabbi.

401
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,700
I thought when god takes someone young

402
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,600
they're usually a good person.

403
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,300
That's the one thing I had going for me.

404
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:30,000
Well god is... is apparently making an exception in your case.

405
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,900
Larry, is your house in order?

406
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,700
I mean you should have everything settled by now.

407
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,300
My business manager, Matt.

408
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,300
- I... I worked things out with him.
- Good, good.

409
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,700
I supposed I could have traveled more.

410
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,700
- Yeah.
- But where was I gonna go?

411
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,800
I went to Europe once.

412
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,000
No big deal.

413
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,600
The truth is, Rabbi, I can't stand packing.

414
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,000
You know, Larry,

415
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
we all have moments in our life when

416
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,200
we've acted out of thoughtlessness and

417
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,200
we've been inconsiderate to other people.

418
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,400
Is there anybody, right now, that you can think of

419
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,400
you'd like to ask for forgiveness and

420
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,000
make right with?

421
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,400
When you walk through my door, you play by my rules.

422
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
You take off your fucking shoes!

423
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,800
Devoted sister? Beloved cunt?

424
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,500
He's a racist.

425
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,500
A bona fide racist who preferred not to work with any black people

426
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,900
under any circumstances.

427
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,800
You fucked up.

428
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,300
Larry, you ate the baby Jesus and his mother Mary.

429
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
- You were following my wife?!
- I wasn't following her!

430
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,700
She called the cops on you.

431
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,900
What do you mean to... look at me.

432
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,700
You knew that my brother-in-law died on September 11th.

433
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,400
How dare you say something like that?

434
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,700
See, if this were yours it would say, "fucking douche bag".

435
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,800
You mother-fucking, cock-sucking son of a bitch bastard!

436
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,800
I will body-slam you so hard, that you will poop your bald pants.

437
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,700
You need a good fucking ass kicking.

438
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
That's what you need.

439
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,400
You want to name our baby "Tang"?

440
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
Hey! Hold the door!

441
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,900
No, this is my jacket!

442
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
What are you, crazy?

443
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,100
- Stop it!
- My neck! My neck!

444
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,000
- Don't push me again, you stupid...
- Larry!

445
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,100
- Get him, Joseph!
- Take it back!

446
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,200
This is ours. This is ours.

447
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,700
- Kill him, Joseph. Kill him!
- Shut up, Mary.

448
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,500
You're a disgrace to your people.

449
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,200
Fuck you.

450
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,400
Motherfucker, what the fuck?

451
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,800
Larry, you piece of shit.

452
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,300
- You be quiet, big nose.
- Go fuck yourself.

453
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,800
- Freak you.
- Freak you!

454
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,000
- Asshole.
- Thanks for nothing.

455
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,800
Get out right now!

456
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,000
Good boy!

457
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Banzai!

458
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Nah.

459
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Jeff.

460
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,700
You know,

461
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,100
I've never said anything,

462
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,400
but I've noticed, you use way too much mayo.

463
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,400
You know, when they make tuna,

464
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,000
there's already mayo in it.

465
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You don't have to put it on the bread.

466
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,100
I'll use less mayo, I promise.

467
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,100
Also...

468
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,200
you really never should have let me do that Seinfeld "tv guide" cover.

469
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,200
I really looked like an asshole.

470
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,400
My mistake. I'm so sorry.

471
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,000
- Anything else?
- No.

472
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Okay.

473
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Dad.

474
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,800
I'm sorry about the adoption.

475
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,700
You're... you're what?

476
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,600
The adop... the adoption.

477
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,200
The doc... the doctor?

478
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,000
ad... adoption.

479
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You want a doctor?

480
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,500
A doctor?

481
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,200
- Mr. David...
- He... he wants... I guess he wants a doctor.

482
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Yeah, why don't you step... step right back here.

483
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,500
Lar.

484
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,900
Cheryl.

485
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,100
I know it's gonna be...

486
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,100
a long time till I see you again,

487
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,400
so would it be okay if...

488
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
I fooled around a little...

489
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
until you got there?

490
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,400
Sure.

491
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,300
Is there anything else?

492
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,800
I know it was you

493
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,500
who misplaced that "Sopranos" DVD cover.

494
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,800
It couldn't have been me.

495
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,100
I have a system.

496
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,600
I... I have...

497
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
I have a system.

498
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Larry?

499
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Is there anything you can tell me about his will?

500
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,700
I mean, I know it's...

501
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,500
it's awkward timing but he was very secretive for...

502
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,400
a while there at the end and I just...
- uh, Cheryl...

503
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,400
this 5,000... you want the $5,000?

504
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,600
- Of course.
- Cheryl, that's unreasonable. It really is.

505
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,900
He manipulated Jeff. Jeff had no choice but to say "yes".

506
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,500
I just heard him say it was the blue book value on it.

507
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,300
- It's a petty wish.
- You don't need the money.

508
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,800
He's petty in life, he's petty in death.

509
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,700
It's not... That's not the point.

510
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,100
Cheryl, you have a lot of money.

511
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,100
- You said you were gonna give me...
- It was a... No, no, Cheryl.

512
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
He did not rip him off.

513
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Hello.

514
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,700
We're your guides.

515
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,200
We've been watching you your whole life.

516
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Please.

517
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,800
- You're my guides?
- Yeah, but you are dead.

518
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,700
You did die.

519
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,800
You know Larry, you've got a lot of fans up here.

520
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,100
- Really?
- You've heard of Ponce de Leon?

521
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,800
- Yeah, the Spanish explorer.
- Yeah.

522
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,000
- I wrote a screenplay about him.
- He knows that. He loves it.

523
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,300
Get outta here.

524
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,200
Larry, Marilyn Monroe was a huge fan of the Seinfeld show.

525
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,100
- What?
- It's true.

526
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,400
- You're kidding.
- No.

527
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
She's very much looking forward to meeting you.

528
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,800
- Get out.
- She talks often of you.

529
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,600
Marilyn Monroe?

530
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,300
- It's true, isn't it?
- The truth.

531
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,900
It's your mother, Larry.

532
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,500
Say hello to your mother.

533
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,900
What kind of schmuck are you?!

534
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,900
I mean, who goes around giving their kidney to people?

535
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,000
Idiot!

536
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,900
And I'm surprised that your father let you do such a thing.

537
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,500
Wait till I see him again.

538
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,400
Why did you tell dad not to bother me when you died?

539
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,400
- I missed your funeral.
- So what? What's so important?

540
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,200
Why were you so happy when you thought you were adopted?

541
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,600
That's what I wanna know.

542
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,300
- I wasn't happy.
- Oh, don't give me that.

543
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,200
- You were very happy.
- I was not happy.

544
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,000
- You were absolutely giddy.
- No, I was not giddy.

545
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
- Giddy? I was not giddy.
- You were giddy.

546
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,900
I'm not done with you yet, Buster.

547
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,900
Hey, Larry.

548
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Come here.

549
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,800
Ben Hogan.

550
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Yes, sir.

551
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,500
How you doing?

552
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
Pretty good.

553
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,700
You know, I've been watching your golf game.

554
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,600
- You've seen me play?
- I have seen you play.

555
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,400
And let me tell you something.

556
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
You're moving your feet.

557
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,100
I know, Ben. I move my feet.

558
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah, you know that sex offender had a good tip for you.

559
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,900
- I know. Dropping the club.
- Dropping your...

560
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,100
I can't do it, Ben.

561
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,800
I can't. I've tried.

562
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,700
Why don't you come out with me? We'll shoot 18.

563
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,500
I'll show you how it's done, huh?

564
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,400
- There's golf here?
- Absolutely.

565
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,400
We got great courses up here.

566
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
- You got a date.
- I'll be waitin' for you.

567
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,200
I'm playing golf with Ben Hogan.

568
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,500
It's called heaven.

569
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,000
Come on.

570
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You guys, you've been around me my whole life?

571
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,700
Oh yeah.

572
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,600
You were at the spin-the-bottle party when I ran out when I was 12

573
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,000
- 'cause I was...
- We were there.

574
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yes, I always wanted to ask you about that.

575
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,900
- Why were you so humiliated?
- I felt so humiliated.

576
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,100
You should've stayed.

577
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,200
I didn't... I couldn't kiss anybody. I didn't wanna kiss anybody.

578
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,900
- Nancy loved you then.
- I was scared.

579
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,500
- Let me ask you something.
- Okay.

580
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,700
Did you hear my wife telling me that I could...

581
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
she said I could fool around?

582
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,200
- Yes, we heard.
- You heard her say that, right?

583
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,100
All right, so, if you go on a date, where do you go?

584
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,800
Are there restaurants? Are there movies?

585
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,000
Like, how does that work?

586
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,200
What do you do here all day?

587
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
- Larry, Larry...
- ... and what about this clothing?

588
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,200
- I need socks and underwear.
- You'll learn all that in due time.

589
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,800
- Just be patient.
- I'm just asking a question.

590
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,000
We understand that.

591
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,800
So, if you're my guides,

592
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,800
then how come you let me eat those seven pieces of pizza at camp?

593
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,700
- Remember, I got sick and had to go home?
- Yes, we remember everything.

594
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,400
Yeah, Larry, listen.

595
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,700
We're your guides.

596
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,000
We can't actually control events.

597
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,600
When then, what's the point of the whole thing? I mean, who...

598
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,100
Why do I even need you? What does a guide do?

599
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,500
I don't even get it.

600
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,300
And what about going to the bathroom?

601
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,400
Because, I notice I've been here a while and frankly I don't have to do anything.

602
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,900
And if that's the case...

603
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,000
that's gonna be pretty good.

604
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,400
Pretty good.

605
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,900
- Oh, one more thing.
- Yes, what is it?

606
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,000
- "The Sopranos" DVD cover...
- The cover.

607
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Any idea?

608
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,700
Did you look behind the couch, Larry?

609
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,100
- Behind the couch?
- It's behind the couch.

610
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,600
Did you once look behind the couch, Larry?

611
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,900
- You didn't, did you?
- Well, I didn't really look for it.

612
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,400
Because you had a system.

613
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
That's right. I have a system.

614
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,100
I take the DVD...

615
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,400
... cover and put it on top of the DVD player.

616
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,400
- Right, exactly.
- That's not a system.

617
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
- Oh, is that so?
- A system is...

618
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,100
is that you know you're gonna misplace the DVD

619
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,800
so you get some DVD jackets,

620
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,300
just plain ones, and you have them there in case you lose a...

621
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,000
that's a system.

622
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,800
- That's not a system.
- You keep the jackets in a folder.

623
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,300
It's a system.
- People misplace DVD's because...

624
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,400
they take the cover and they put it someplace else.

625
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,200
And the people that misplace the DVD's

626
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,900
- have extra DVD jackets.
- Whoa, okay.

627
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,400
- That's a system.
- No, that's not a system.

628
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,200
- Listen to your guide. You take the DVD...
- A little bit of respect.

629
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,200
Mr. Great guide who let me do that "tv guide" cover.

630
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,900
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

631
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,800
- Fuck you. Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

632
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,200
Okay, all right, okay. Take it easy. Just come over here and relax.

633
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
- What do you mean, relax?
- Okay, come on.

634
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Larry, um...

635
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,800
we've decided that you're not really ready and we're...

636
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,300
we're gonna send you back into your body.

637
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,400
- What?
- We're sending you back.

638
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,400
What, because I said something about the system?

639
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,800
You're just not ready.

640
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,300
Okay, maybe it isn't much of a system.

641
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,900
You're right, it's not. It's a bad system.

642
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,100
It's not a good system.

643
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,900
- Goodbye, Larry.
- We're sorry.

644
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,200
- Come on. That's not fair.
- Goodbye, Larry.

645
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,800
Goodbye, Larry.

646
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,000
Give me another chance.

647
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,300
Wait wait, I like it here.

648
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,600
- Where you goin', Larry?
- Marilyn.

649
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,200
I was so looking forward to meeting you.

650
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,200
I really love your sense of humor.

651
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,500
- Marilyn!
- Don't go, Larry.

652
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
- Marilyn!
- Don't go.

653
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,400
I'm not paying. I'm not paying.

654
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,500
Look, I'm not paying it. I'm not.

655
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
- What?
- Oh my god.

656
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
- Larry?
- My god.

657
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,700
Jesus.

658
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,000
Oh my god.

659
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,300
You notice how in the movies

660
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,800
they never fold when they're packing?

661
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,000
They just throw everything in.

662
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,800
- Hm-mm.
- It's not believable.

663
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,300
- You know?
- It's not interesting to watch, really.

664
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,500
Well, still,

665
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,900
you have to pack the right way.

666
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,100
People just don't crumple up their clothes

667
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,900
and throw them in a suitcase. That's not real.

668
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,100
I'm not buying that.

669
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,900
You look good.

670
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
- You do.
- Really?
- Yeah, you look good,

671
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
you know?

672
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,600
You know, I gotta talk to the doctor.

673
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,900
See if I got some clearance, some sex clearance.

674
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,700
Do you have to get clearance for that?

675
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,700
I think you do.

676
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Needless to say, I'm quite prepared.

677
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,000
Okay. All right.

678
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,400
- What a thing, huh?
- Yeah.

679
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,100
How do you feel?

680
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,100
You feel different after all this?

681
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,300
You know, yeah.

682
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,900
- I mean, come on, I'm a changed man.
- I know.

683
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,600
- I'm a completely different person. 
- That's true.

684
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,300
- You really feel like that now?
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

685
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,200
- I know what you mean.
- You know what I mean?

686
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,700
- I don't need to say it, right?
- No, it's good. No no.

687
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,600
- Oh, hey.
- Hey. Your chariot, sir.

688
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,700
- What's this?
- Hospital policy.

689
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,300
You get to leave in a wheelchair.

690
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,800
Hmm, all right.

691
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

692
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,900
Very excited about this.

693
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,700
Hello.

694
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,000
- And, uh...
- Hey, you know what?

695
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,700
I think maybe I should use the bathroom before we go.

696
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,200
- Okay.
- Let's try the handicapped.

697
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
- Larry.
- It's a rare opportunity, come on.

698
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,800
Oh, someone must be in there.

699
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,300
- Hey.
- Hey.

700
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,400
What's with the walking here?

701
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,900
I had to use the bathroom.

702
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,000
Okay, I get it.

703
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,200
That one was occupied.

704
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,900
I had to duck in here for a second.

705
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,500
It was a bit of an emergency.

706
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,600
Well then you wait.

707
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,100
You wait.
