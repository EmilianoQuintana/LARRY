Episode 5x04 : Kamikaze Bingo

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,200
Ahh, chicken teriyaki boy!

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,700
Chicken teriyaki boy!

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,200
- Gentlemen!
- Chicken.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,500
I loved it when it was so big, you know?

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,200
Until today, I never even thought about that,

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,700
you know 'cause usually...

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,900
- Hello!
- Hello.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,900
You remember Yoshi.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,500
- Yoshi!
- Hello, nice to see you.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,700
I like that, a little bow.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,500
See that?

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,200
- I did.
- I love that bow.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,000
I am nuts about that bow.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,700
It humbles you.

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,000
And we've got so many cocky people in this country.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,800
They need the humility of the bow here.

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,200
- It's big in Japan.
- You should see...

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,500
some of the sculptures that we saw today.

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,700
- Really?
- Mmhm, there's one that I think will be

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,000
perfect in our house once we get back to it.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
- Tell him about...
- We're looking for a big penis.

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,200
Did they have anything at the gallery?

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,400
- Uh, not quite, no.
- He's... no.

25
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,900
- With some big balls...
- Okay, we've actually been talking...

26
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,300
- that's nice.
- ...seriously about art, and it's not...

27
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,300
look at this.

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,000
"Cofey was here".

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,900
What kind of moron is this Cofey,

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,300
carving his nick... I mean, what is that?
- It's a shame.

31
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,600
- Yeah, it's very childish.
- Takes a knife out and carves into the table?

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,400
- Inappropriate.
- How inappropriate is that?

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,100
Hey, by the way,

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,900
my dad and your dad are becoming very friendly in that nursing home.

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,300
- Yes, yes.
- Oh no, isn't that cute?

36
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,300
It was just his 80th birthday party.

37
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,700
We took him to Japan.

38
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,600
- No kidding?
- Really?

39
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Yes, he hadn't been back since the war.

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,200
He saw some of his family...

41
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,300
- oh my gosh.
- ...and some of his military buddies

42
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,800
- from the air force.
- He was in the war?

43
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,700
What did he do in the war?

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,600
- He was a pilot.
- Really? What kind of a pilot?

45
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,200
- A kamikaze pilot.
- Wow.

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,900
Wouldn't he be dead?

47
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,900
Um, not all of them died.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I know, but kamikaze pilot

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,100
kind of implies that...

50
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,600
you know a kamikaze pilot is a pilot who crashed and died, right?

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,500
- But he didn't.
- He survived, yes.

52
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,100
- Thank goodness for that.
- He survived?

53
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,100
- Here's to... what did you say?
- Kanpai.

54
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,500
But what happened exactly?

55
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,300
Did he try and crash the plane into a ship?

56
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,900
Ahem, he grazed the ship.

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Okay.

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,100
- All right.
- All right, he grazed the ship.

59
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,100
He grazed it.

60
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,600
Is that because there was some kind of malfunction with the plane?

61
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,400
It doesn't really matter. He grazed it...

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
- I'm just curious.
- ...and he lived, and...

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,100
- and he is alive.
- And he's alive.

64
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,100
Yeah, but at the last second, what happened?

65
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,800
Was he coming down, all of a sudden, he said,

66
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
"Jesus, this kamikaze business might not be for me".

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
"I think maybe I'll... go back to base"?

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
- Okay, you know, it's...
- Was is something like that, huh?

69
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,600
So what happened at the last second there?

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I'm uncertain.

71
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,100
You know what's good is the rainbow roll,

72
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,200
because it gives you a little bit of everything. Hi.

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,500
- Are you ready to order?
- Yes.

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,200
I will have the chicken teriyaki.

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Chicken teriyaki.

76
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,100
Chicken!

77
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Chicken.

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Chicken!

79
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,100
How about you, Yosh? A little chicken?

80
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,800
So, you know, I hired a private investigator

81
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,300
to find out if I'm adopted.
- What do you care now for?

82
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,600
Isn't the damage done already

83
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,800
- from your parents?
- I wouldn't want to know, to be honest with you.

84
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Hey, how's Lewis? You hear from Lewis?

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,200
He's... something wrong with his kidney.

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,800
Oh yeah? What, like a stone or something?

87
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,100
I don't know what he's got. He's getting tests.

88
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,600
- Fold your card.
- I don't know anything about it

89
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,800
- I just know he's concerned.
- He gets so worked up.

90
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,700
- It doesn't surprise me.
- He doesn't look that good.

91
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm in.

92
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,700
I'm going to present to you a nice little straight with a seven high.

93
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,300
- It's no good. I got a flush.
- Thank you very much.

94
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
- Again?
- I think it's a trick deck.

95
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,000
- Yeah, that's a nice hand.
- He was born to poker players

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,700
and given up for adoption.

97
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,700
- Here are some pretzels.
- Oh, thank you.

98
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,200
Did the pizza place call by any chance?

99
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,000
Hey, what happened, isn't your brother playing?

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,300
- Yeah, where's Yoshi?
- Yeah, what happened to your brother?

101
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,100
- He told me last night he was coming.
- Yeah, Yoshi's supposed to be here.

102
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,400
But I can't get a hold of him. Maybe he's stuck in traffic.

103
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Hey, so our fathers are becoming very friendly

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,400
at the nursing home.
- Really?

105
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
- We should all get together sometime.
- Absolutely!

106
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
I'll be there tomorrow.

107
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,900
- I'm gonna play a little bingo.
- Maybe your father.

108
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
- Bingo is the only thing in the world...
- I'm gonna check on pizza.

109
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,300
that I feel any sense of optimist about.

110
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,700
- You play bingo?
- When I play I actually think I'm gonna win.

111
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,000
Isn't that insane?

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
- Do you win?
- I do win.

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
- it's completely random.
- I know it's random.

114
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,400
- I have a winning percentage that defies logic.
- Nobody does !

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,700
You win more often than the other people?

116
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,700
- Yes, exactly.
- He gets more diagonals than anybody.

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What? Oh my god.

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
What...

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,500
Cedars sinai, okay. We'll be right there. Bye.

120
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,300
- What's wrong?
- Mayuki, Yoshi tried to commit suicide.

121
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,300
- What?!
- He tried to commit suicide. Cedars sinai.

122
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,900
I gotta leave. I'll be back.

123
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,400
Get the coat, get the coat.

124
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,200
- Keys keys keys.
- Yes, it's in here.

125
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Let's go.

126
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,200
Suicide?

127
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,300
- Jeez Louise!
- Oh wow.

128
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,300
I just saw him last night.

129
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,400
We had dinner with him.

130
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,700
- You did?
- Really...

131
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,200
Did he seem weird?

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
- No.
- Was he nervous? Was he anxious?

133
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,600
Could he have lost face or have been ashamed or humiliated or anything?

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,100
So...

135
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,100
what should we do?

136
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,100
Well, you know,

137
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,200
we're here.
- We are here.

138
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
That's true, because, you know,

139
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,500
I had to really finagle to get out tonight.

140
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
I'm kinda happy to be anywhere.

141
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,400
And you know, we can't leave the house.

142
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
- It's... they're gone.
- We don't have keys.

143
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,600
And we don't know the alarm code or anything.

144
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,600
- And a pizza is coming.
- Got a pizza coming, yeah.

145
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,700
And he tried, he didn't actually kill himself, he just tried.

146
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,900
That's a very good distinction. Because if he said he tried to...

147
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,400
That means he didn't, which means he's alive.

148
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
- He's here.
- Thank god.

149
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,300
- A pair of fours.
- I'm gonna see what else is in the fridge.

150
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,800
What the hell is going on?

151
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,100
- Hey.
- How's Yoshi?

152
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,200
- You're still playing?
- Yeah.

153
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
- I took an orange.
- You want some pizza?

154
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,500
What are you doing here?

155
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
What do you mean?

156
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,900
Yoshi's in the hospital. He tried to commit suicide!

157
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,600
- How's he doing?
- He's okay, right?

158
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,200
How's he doing?! He almost killed himself!

159
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,900
- I know!
- We figured it was...

160
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,600
- I told you guys we should leave.
- You figured what?

161
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,300
- You never said that.
- I said we should leave !

162
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,500
- Hey, get out!
- You ordered another pizza!

163
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
- Get the fuck out. Get out, get out!
- What?

164
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,000
It's over. It's over. Out.

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,400
Out. Out. It's over. It's over.

166
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,600
- Leave. Leave.
- We didn't even settle up!

167
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,900
- Can we settle up?
- Out!

168
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,600
- I was up about $400.
- Let's go. Out. Out.

169
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
- Man, oh man.
- Let's go.

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Pizza was coming, it would have been rude to leave a pizza guy...

171
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,800
It would have been rude to stop and pick it up on your way home, too.

172
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,200
We didn't know your alarm code.

173
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,700
I don't have an alarm!

174
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,900
Did Yoshi mention my name?

175
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,700
- He's got tubes coming out of his mouth.
- Okay.

176
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,200
- That means no.
- All right.

177
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,300
- Get the fuck out.
- All right.

178
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,800
Say hello for me if you see him.

179
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh my god, did you hear what happened to Yoshi?

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,300
Yeah, he's okay, though. He didn't... he's fine.

181
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,800
Thank god!

182
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah.

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
- How do you know?
- He sent me a suicide email.

184
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
A suicide email?!

185
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,500
He had some things he wanted to say before he...

186
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,000
What did he say?

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,300
It's very private, Larry.

188
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,000
Hey, we're married, you know.

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,100
It's part of the whole marriage thing.

190
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,200
I have to tell you, when you get married,

191
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,300
you not only get the sex, but you get all the other stuff too.

192
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,300
All the information from the wife who doesn't hold any secrets.

193
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
If he wanted you to see it, he would have copied you.

194
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,000
Did he copy other people?

195
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He cc'd a few people, yes.

196
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,400
Are you kidding?!

197
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,000
I wanna know. What did he say?

198
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,700
Stop it!

199
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,500
I'll delete it. I'll just delete it.

200
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,700
Stop it, get off me.

201
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,100
N-44.

202
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,100
- Four four!
- You're so noisy.

203
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,600
- One to go.
- I don't believe it.

204
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,600
- Need one!
- G-41.

205
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,300
- G-41.
- 41, yeah.

206
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
- G-41.
- Not in my purview.

207
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,800
Not in my purview.

208
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,900
I-20.

209
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
- I-20.
- I-20?

210
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,700
- I-20.
- Bingo!

211
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,700
Oh, he has...

212
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,300
- Oh my!
- Bingo.

213
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,200
- I don't believe it.
- Bingo.

214
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,900
- All right.
- Let me see, let me...

215
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,000
You're not the checker. Lenore is the checker.

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,900
- Lenore, Lenore, check this out.
- Bingo. Watch.

217
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
Let's see it. Okay...

218
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,900
Okay, I'm sorry, sir.

219
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,900
I did not call I-17.

220
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
- What are you talking about?
- No, I never did.

221
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,300
- I-17, yeah, I-17.
- That is not correct.

222
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,300
- I did not call I-17.
- You... excuse me, excuse me...

223
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,300
Cheat.

224
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,000
- All right, just be patient.
- You called I-17. Let me see that pad.

225
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
- No, you're not gonna see this pad.
- Why? Let me take a look at it!

226
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,800
- Nobody checks out this pad.
- Why can't I check out your pad?

227
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,200
- Because I never let anyone look at my pad.
- Really? Aha.

228
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
- She never does.
- Good for you, Lenore.

229
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,300
we're going to continue with the game.

230
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,300
Just try to relax.

231
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,300
You gotta listen to her. She knows what she's doing.

232
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Well, listen, she's my friend.

233
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,500
G-55.

234
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,300
- What's the number? I don't know the number.
- Bingo!

235
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,700
Oh, she... oh, she has... bingo!

236
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,700
Ruthie, do we have bingo?

237
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,100
- B-I-N-G-O!
- Let me see, Ruthie.

238
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,600
- There it is.
- Oh, well...

239
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
she has the bingo.

240
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
- Oh yes, perfect!
- Yes, of course.

241
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,400
- Ruthie gets a dollar!
- Ha-ha, I won a dollar!

242
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,600
I won, everybody! I won!

243
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,900
- Oh, sit down. Sit down.
- Bingo!

244
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,400
I had bingo. You all know I had bingo.

245
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,900
And I won your dollar.

246
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,100
There's something fishy going on in this place.

247
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,100
I'm gonna buy you a piece of cheesecake.

248
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Thank you very much. I love cheesecake.

249
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,500
I had bingo!

250
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,300
...101.

251
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,800
Actually I took the 110

252
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,700
- up to the... through the pass.
- Oh, hey.

253
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Hello.

254
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Hey, my wife tells me Yoshi's doing great.

255
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,800
Yeah, he's fine. He's home now.

256
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,100
Good news! Fantastic.

257
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,700
Let me ask you something.

258
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,500
Have you ever played in that bingo game?

259
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Have you ever noticed anything strange going on there?

260
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,000
I need to talk to you, Larry.

261
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,800
Don't, don't try to get involved.

262
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,000
Don't try to pretend you're concerned.

263
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,500
- I was concerned.
- Concerned?

264
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,200
When we went to the hospital, I come back,

265
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,100
you guys are all still playing poker, smoking cigars and eating pizza.

266
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,900
That's precisely why we were there, because we were concerned.

267
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,900
We wanted to show you support, so when you got home your buddies would be there

268
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,100
and you're turning it into a bad thing.

269
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Yoshi tried to commit suicide,

270
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,700
and you just completely put it out of your head.

271
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,900
We didn't put it out of our head.

272
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
We thought of it between hands.

273
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,700
Here's what you should be concerned about...

274
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,700
you're the reason why Yoshi tried to commit suicide.

275
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,700
Come on, how's that possible?

276
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,800
The whole kamikaze thing.

277
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,700
I was curious about it, so I asked.

278
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,900
Excuse me for having a curious mind that asks questions of people.

279
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,800
I'm curious about how you can be a kamikaze pilot

280
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,000
and still be alive.

281
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
There's a lot of kamikaze pilots that are still alive.

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,700
You say that, and I say to you,

283
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,600
they are not kamikaze pilots.

284
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,100
"He grazed the ship".

285
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,600
That sounds to me like

286
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
"I think I might head home. This is fucking insane".

287
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
You taunted him, you called him chicken.

288
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,200
I didn't call him chicken,

289
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,500
- I ordered chicken!
- You called him chicken.

290
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,200
I ordered chicken, you idiot. There's the difference.

291
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,500
Here's the difference :

292
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
"You're a chicken".
"I'll have some chicken".

293
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,200
"You're a chicken".
"I'd like a piece of chicken".

294
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Well, he understood it as you calling him a chicken.

295
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,200
He must have taken it the wrong way.

296
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,700
And what about you coming and sweeping the chips off the table?

297
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,100
You cost me a lot of money.

298
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,700
I know for a fact you were down $300.

299
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,700
You actually owe me $300 if you wanna get technical about it.

300
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,600
I'll tell you what. I'll get your chips back,

301
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,500
you'll get your money back, but you're gotta do one thing...

302
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
you gotta call Yoshi at home, he's home right now

303
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,400
and apologize for the whole kamikaze statement

304
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,200
and the chicken thing.
- Okay, I will.

305
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,900
- Okay. I'm gonna call him and apologize.
- Okay.

306
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,400
I'll use my dad's phone.

307
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
Hello.

308
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,400
Oh, hey, Yoshi, this is Larry David.

309
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,800
Oh, hello Larry.

310
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm actually...

311
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,400
I'm calling to apologize.

312
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
I'm sorry if I said anything that might have been inappropriate.

313
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,800
I didn't... I didn't really mean anything...

314
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,300
to happen. I was just kinda curious...

315
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
...with the whole kamikaze thing.

316
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,300
- You know, I hope...
- Are you eating something?

317
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,800
I'm eating pistachio nuts.

318
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,800
You're eating pistachio nuts while you're apologizing to me?

319
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Yes, so?

320
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,500
You can't be sincere about apologizing and then snack on pistachio nuts!

321
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,200
What? I can eat and apologize.

322
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,900
There's no pistachio crunching in apologizing.

323
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,900
I respectfully disagree. I've snacked and apologized many times in the past

324
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,400
and everyone's always accepted it quite graciously.

325
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,000
Well that might be the way you do things in your family,

326
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,300
but we don't snack and apologize...
- What, is that a Japanese thing?

327
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,200
No! No, that's a human thing...

328
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Hey, did you mention me in that suicide email?

329
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,400
- Hi.
- Oh Larry, I'm glad to see you.

330
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,200
- How are you, Dr. Skadden?
- I'm good. How's your dad?

331
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,700
- I think he's doing well.
- If think he's doing real well.

332
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,800
I'm gonna write him a little prescription though.

333
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,500
- Maybe you want to have it filled.
- Okay.

334
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,000
A little blood thinner.

335
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
You know, I'm kinda glad I ran into you.

336
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,900
I wanna talk to you a little bit about something that happened to me today.

337
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,500
- And let's keep this between the two of us, okay?
- Sure.

338
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,400
In the bingo game today...

339
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,100
I won, I yelled "bingo".

340
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,100
Lenore, the woman who runs the game, came over,

341
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,300
looked at my card and said she didn't call one of the numbers.

342
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,300
Now look, I can hear better than anybody in that room, okay?

343
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,800
She called my number.

344
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,400
I listen, I pay attention.

345
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,300
I'm a good bingo player.

346
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,100
A minute later Ruth wins.

347
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Lenore came over, and she gives the dollar to her friend.

348
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
And don't tell me, after that game

349
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
her friend Ruthie wasn't giving her 50¢, all right?

350
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,600
I won that game, fair and square. Fair and square.

351
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,800
Okay, so Larry, you think lenore is taking kick-back

352
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
from calling the numbers? Is that what you're saying?

353
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,900
Yes, I think the bingo game is fixed.

354
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,500
I think Lenore...

355
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,500
is either in cahoots with Ruth or maybe even a few other people. I don't even know.

356
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,000
You know what you should do?

357
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,900
Take off your little smock here,

358
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,200
take off your tie, sit in on a game,

359
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,100
keep your ears open. Keep your ears open. Listen,

360
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,800
to see who's winning at the bingo game.

361
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,800
You want me to go undercover to play bingo? Is that what you're saying?

362
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,000
Do you know anything about this game, doctor,

363
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
that you're not telling me?

364
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I know the bingo is for the residents, Larry.

365
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,200
And I know it takes place on wednesdays and fridays.

366
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,100
That's what I know, and I know they enjoy it.

367
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,900
Well, in a week or two, you're gonna come up to me and go,

368
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,200
"Larry, you know what?"

369
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
"You were right about that bingo game".

370
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,800
- I will check into it.
- Good, that's all I ask.

371
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,500
That's all I ask. Just ask around.
- I'll be happy to.

372
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,800
Do a little check into it. That's all I ask.

373
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,500
- I'm not asking a lot.
- No, not at all.

374
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,600
- Thank you. Okay.
- Okay, Larry.

375
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,100
- You have a good day.
- You too.

376
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,900
- Hello.
- How are you?

377
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,300
I'm well.

378
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
- I have a prescription.
- Okay.

379
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,500
Is this for you?

380
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,300
- No, it's for my father.
- Father.

381
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,800
Blood thinner.

382
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
You know, there's another drug out on the market

383
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,700
that I personally like a lot better.

384
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

385
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,700
My patients are...

386
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
they're a lot happier with the other drug.

387
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,300
If you like, I could write it down for you.

388
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,400
But the doctor prefers this one.

389
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Yes,

390
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
but I prefer the other one.

391
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
But he likes this one.

392
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
But I like that one.

393
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,200
Doctor...

394
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
pharmacist.

395
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Doctor!

396
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
Pharmacist.

397
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,900
I'll go with the pharmacist.

398
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
- I'm going with the pharmacist.
- Yes, sir.

399
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,600
I'm taking this to the doctor,

400
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,800
I'm getting a new prescription

401
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,300
and I'll be back, Mr. Pharmacist.

402
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,700
- I'm glad.
- I'm going with you.

403
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,200
Thank you, sir.

404
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,000
Hey Larry, how are you?

405
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,800
Any progress on, uh...

406
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,600
the bingo... the bingo business?

407
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,200
- No, no word on the bingo.
- Nothin'?

408
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,900
Nothin'.

409
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,700
Keep your eye on this Ruth.

410
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,800
- Ruth?
- Yeah, Ruth.

411
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,300
She's bad news, I'm telling you.

412
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,500
There's something about this woman I don't trust at all.

413
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,700
I don't know how she got into this place. Don't they have a screening process of some kind?

414
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,400
Yes, Larry, we screen them to make sure they're old and sick and need care.

415
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,800
Well, she's got some kind of personality disorder I think.

416
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,200
Well, she's on a lot of medication.

417
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,900
You think that's an excuse really?

418
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,700
That's like the twinkie defense.

419
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,300
- I'll continue to investigate, Larry.
- Okay.

420
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,900
Um, one other thing.

421
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,900
I just came from the pharmacist.

422
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He kinda wants to go a different way with the medication.

423
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Sorta disagreed with you.

424
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,400
- The pharmacist?
- Yeah, he wrote...

425
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,100
he wrote out a drug here. I don't know what it is,

426
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,100
but I need a prescription from you...

427
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,700
for... for this.

428
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,000
You need a prescription from me for something the pharmacist has suggested?

429
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,500
He was quite passionate about it.

430
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,500
You know, he deals with this stuff all the time.

431
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,300
I'm a doctor, Larry.

432
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,300
Well, he's a pharmacist.

433
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,800
Yes, and I'm a doctor.

434
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,200
He's a pharmacist.

435
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
Doctor.

436
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Pharmacist.

437
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,100
Doctor.

438
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,600
Pharmacist.

439
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,700
Fine, you go with the pharmacist.

440
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,600
Okay. Thank you.

441
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,000
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Have yourself a nice day.

442
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,500
Thank you!

443
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Oh yes, fuck me!

444
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,100
I want your cock.

445
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Oh, fuck me! It feels so good, oh!

446
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,500
Yes, yes!

447
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,700
Oh, I want your big cock!

448
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,800
- Fuck me!
- Yes!

449
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Oh god, yes!
Oh!

450
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,900
Fuck me! Fuck me!

451
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,200
Yes! Oh my god!

452
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Yeah! Fuck yeah!

453
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Whoo! Yeah!

454
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Dad!

455
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,400
Dad, I'm coming in.

456
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Shh shh.

457
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,300
You... I can hear it in the lobby, this thing!

458
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,600
So what? I can't hear, you know?

459
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
- It's too loud!
- It's very hard for me.

460
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,300
I can't hear. Please...

461
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,200
Oh, you turned it off.

462
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,900
Come on.

463
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,000
We can't watch porno together.

464
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,200
I don't think...

465
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
we don't have that kind of relationship yet.

466
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,800
But you ruined it for me now.

467
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,000
- Sorry.
- All right.

468
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
- Hey, that bingo game...
- Yeah.

469
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,500
Something's fishy.

470
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,700
- What are you talking about? About bingo?
- You noticed anything strange going on in that...

471
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,800
...like Ruthie, does she win a lot?

472
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,300
Of course she wins a lot. This woman is a winner.

473
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,200
She wins a lot?

474
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,000
Yes, of course she wins a lot.

475
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,500
- She plays a lot...
- Come in.

476
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,900
Hello there, Nattie!

477
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,000
- Hello, Ruthie. Come on.
- Good afternoon.

478
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
- Yes, hello.
- Come, sit down. We'll sit, we'll talk a little bit.

479
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
This is wonderful.

480
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,800
So what are you two guys talking about?

481
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,300
- To tell you the truth, he has some crazy...
- Oh, you know Tanaka,

482
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,200
the Japanese guy, his son tried to kill himself.

483
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
But he's home from the hospital, he didn't die.

484
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,300
Oh yeah, good guy...

485
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,100
- No no, "die".
- Lie?

486
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,500
No, "die".

487
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Die, die, die!

488
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,600
You're back.

489
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,600
- I am back, as promised.
- I'm glad.

490
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,000
I gotta tell you something.

491
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,600
The doctor was upset.

492
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,100
Doctors don't like to have their authority questioned.

493
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,800
I told him I had to go with the pharmacist, you know?

494
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,200
We see a lot of drugs.

495
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
I think this is a good choice.

496
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,900
Is that your name?

497
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,900
Cofey?

498
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Yeah.

499
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,400
Have you ever been to that Japanese restaurant

500
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
- across the street?
- Oh yeah, eat there all the time.

501
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,100
So Cofey was there.

502
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,000
You could say that.

503
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
You know what, Cofey?

504
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,700
I think I'll go with the doctor.

505
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,000
Are you gonna try some of this eel?

506
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You know, if you wanna taste my chicken teriyaki,

507
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,600
you don't have to go through this charade of offering me the eel, whatever.

508
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,100
You know just ask me.

509
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,800
I don't want your chicken teriyaki, but thank you.

510
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,900
I know that you do. Here, take a piece.

511
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,400
Here, on me.

512
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,400
Oh, I forgot to tell you,

513
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,600
I was in the pharmacy...

514
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
- Yeah?
- Remember the other day when we were in here

515
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,200
- and I saw "Cofey was here" on the table?
- Mmm-hmm.

516
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,400
- Remember that?
- Yeah.

517
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,400
The pharmacist had a nametag that said "Cofey".

518
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,200
- Really?
- Yeah.

519
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What is this with the blackberry every... all the time now?

520
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,400
It's really getting annoying.

521
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,500
Well I was listening.

522
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,400
- I'm supposed to be meeting Wanda...
- All you do all day long is this blackberry thing.

523
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,800
Well she... 'cause she was gonna tell me when her break was.

524
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,100
- I'm gonna stop by and visit her.
- You're supposed to be talking to me.

525
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
- I... I...
- We're having lunch, you know.

526
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,800
I... the coffee.

527
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,000
All right, I'm going to the bathroom.

528
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Okay.

529
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Chicken teriyaki boy!

530
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Chicken! Chicken!

531
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,100
Stop it!

532
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,500
Yoshi! Yoshi!

533
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,000
- Chicken teriyaki boy!
- That's just great.

534
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,500
Cofey is here!

535
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,200
{\a3}Cofey is here!

536
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,500
{\a1}Cofey is here!

537
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,600
{\a3}Cofey is here!

538
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,800
{\a1}Cofey is here!

539
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,700
{\a3}Cofey!

540
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,700
{\a1}Cofey!

541
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Hey!

542
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,700
You told everyone in the restaurant that Yoshi was a chicken.

543
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,200
I'm chicken teriyaki boy.

544
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,700
That's my nickname, 'cause I always order chicken teriyaki.

545
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,500
So whenever I go in, they go, "oh, chicken teriyaki boy"!

546
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,700
And they call you that.

547
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,800
Yes, that's my name.

548
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,300
- What's going on?
- What's my name in this place?

549
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,800
- Chicken teriyaki boy.
- I'm chicken teriyaki boy.

550
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,500
Nobody has that kind of nickname.

551
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,400
And I kept up my end of the bargain so fork over the money you owe me.

552
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,400
- No, you have not.
- What? I apologized.

553
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,300
He said you were eating something on the phone.

554
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,000
You're not allowed to eat pistachio nuts when you apologize?

555
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,300
By the way, were they with shells or without shells?

556
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,700
- They had shells.
- Okay, so you had to de-shell.

557
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,700
So you're not paying up?

558
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,700
You have not apologized to Yoshi properly.

559
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,700
- It's better not to eat when you apologize.
- Thank you.

560
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,800
I'll tell you what.

561
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Let's go double or nothing. Bingo.

562
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,000
You wanna take me on in bingo?

563
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,900
- Tomorrow, the nursing home, 2:00.
- 2:00.

564
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,800
- Yeah, bingo, that's right.
- Tomorrow. Double or nothing.

565
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,600
Which way you wanna lose? Horizontal, vertical or diagonal?

566
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,300
- You have no idea where you getting into.
- Oh really?

567
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
- Yeah Don't be late.
- Don't worry, I won't.

568
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
We'll see.

569
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,800
Oh no!

570
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,300
Suicide blackberry.

571
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,100
- Bingo!
- Oh, all right, Alice.

572
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,100
I'll be right there to check you out.

573
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,400
- Shove over.
- Jeez, you shouldn't be here.

574
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,500
- What?
- You shouldn't be here.

575
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
- What are you talking about?
- Hand me one of your cards.

576
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,000
- All right, take it.
- Okay.

577
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,200
- You're late.
- I'm here.

578
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,900
- You're late.
- Yeah.

579
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,300
All right, everybody. Are we ready to start another game?

580
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,000
Nobody beats me at bingo.

581
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,700
Nobody!

582
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Really? I haven't read about that.

583
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
B-4.

584
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,500
- B-4. Allright, good start!
- "B" what?

585
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,000
- B-4.
- Four.

586
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
I don't have four.

587
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,500
Wait I have...

588
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,900
B-11.

589
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,000
"B-11"

590
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,700
11... 11...

591
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,100
O-69.

592
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,300
- O-69.
- Okay.

593
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,300
O-62.

594
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,400
Bingo!

595
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,300

597
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
Bin... go!

598
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,000
That's him.

599
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,900
He's the one that tried to kill Ruthie.

600
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,200
- Yes.
- What? What?

601
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Hey hey hey hey, wait wait wait, calm down here.

602
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,100
No, that's ridiculous.

603
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,600
I didn't try to kill her.

604
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,600
Hey, seriously, come on.

605
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,000
Why would I do that?

606
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Oh, I know what you mean. No, 'cause I was talking to my father...

607
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,600
he's a little deaf,

608
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,600
so I have to scream. I was saying, "die, die".

609
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,900
Kev, come on, back me up here.

610
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,100
Kev! Help me out!

611
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,000
Tell them! Kev?

612
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,100
Wait a second.

613
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,400
Sorry about the bingo game.

614
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,200

615
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,800

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
