00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,251
you see? You see
what's going on here?

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,717
See, look at that. It
jumps and then it freezes.

5
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:21,283
- It's frustrating.
- It's very frustrating.

6
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:24,450
- I'm missing all my shows... "lost."
- Oh, last week...

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,283
You know that guy they
killed off the previous week?

8
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:28,151
All right, don't tell
me. I don't wanna know.

9
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:30,550
He's not dead,
he's back. He came back.

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,650
- I just told you not to tell me.
- Shocking.

11
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:35,283
- Are you nuts?
- One of my top five episodes of all time.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,283
By the way, how come you
didn't show up last thursday?

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,084
- You didn't even call.
- We had a lot of appointments last thursday.

14
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:42,984
- So what about the tv?
- Well, I don't think it's your tivo.

15
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,917
It's probably
the satellite,

16
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,517
- but I'm gonna take a look.
- Satellite? Okay.

17
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:07,517
You know, it just gets
a little frustrating.

18
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:09,517
Every time I sit down and
watch it, it's not working.

19
00:01:09,617 --> 00:01:11,084
- Hello?
- Larry!

20
00:01:11,184 --> 00:01:12,650
- Oh, hey, honey.
- Oh my god.

21
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:14,650
Honey, you couldn't call
at a worse time.

22
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:17,950
- I got the tivo guy here.
- Oh my god!

23
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,483
- Hey, you got the warranty on this thing?
- Larry!

24
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,550
- The warranty.
- Oh wait, hold on.

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,483
- We're going through a really big storm right now.
- Hold on one second.

26
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,350
- I need a warranty card.
- Honey, let me ask you a question.

27
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:28,416
Do you have a... Do you know
where the warranty card is

28
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:29,817
- on the tivo?
- No, I-I don't.

29
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:31,817
In case something
happens to me...

30
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:34,184
- I mean, it's really bad.
- Is it in the kitchen drawer by any chance?

31
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:35,817
- What?
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

32
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,283
- What is that? What did you say?
- Do you know who

33
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,917
- the guy was that came out?
- No, I'm not talking to you.

34
00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:41,084
Larry, I just wanna
tell you just in case...

35
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,517
- I can't hear you, honey. Wait, hold on one second.
- ... For some reason

36
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:45,251
- I don't make it home...
- You know who the guy was who came and put this thing in?

37
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,450
- You know who the guy was who installed...
- I don't know.

38
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,450
- I don't know his name.
- Was it tom or something?

39
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,084
- I just want you to know...
- Or don? Something like that?

40
00:01:51,184 --> 00:01:54,683
- Maybe bill or james?
- Oh my god!

41
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:56,483
I'll come back
later this afternoon,

42
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,817
- because it looks like you're really busy.
- Oh no, jeez.

43
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,017
Honey, I'm sorry. You know what? Please.

44
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:01,817
He's gonna go. I'm never
gonna get him again.

45
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,450
It's all
right. I can come back.

46
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,084
No, stay right there. Call
me back in 10 minutes, okay?

47
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,884
- What?
- I'm sorry, sweetheart. I love you.

48
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:08,817
- Keep talking. I'll come back.
- No no, that's okay.

49
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:11,084
- Stay... Stay right here.
- Larry!

50
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:22,984
Isn't he something, billy?

51
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:24,416
Have you ever
seen horses like him?

52
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:26,617
Not quite.

53
00:02:26,717 --> 00:02:30,117
Hey! Turned it off.

54
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,217
Guess what?

55
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:34,650
We're having dinner at primo's
tonight. I made a reservation.

56
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:36,917
That's your husband.

57
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:40,117
I'm leaving.

58
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:46,650
I'm leaving, larry.
I can't do this anymore.

59
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:50,917
You can't do this?
What?

60
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:52,450
What? What?
What are you t...

61
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,817
Does that really
surprise you?

62
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:58,283
What do you mean you're
leaving? What are you doing?

63
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,917
I just called you
from an airplane,

64
00:03:00,017 --> 00:03:01,984
telling you I was
about to crash.

65
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:04,017
The tivo guy was here.

66
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,084
I could barely hear what you were
saying. He was about to leave.

67
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:09,650
I couldn't even get the
guy to come to the house.

68
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,117
You know, it's very hard to get
those people here. It was broken.

69
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:13,583
- Oh, really?
- I got it fixed for you.

70
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,217
- Well, okay.
- I saved all your shows.

71
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,650
"barefoot contessa,"
"top chef," "project runway."

72
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,550
I wouldn't let him. I
saved those shows for you.

73
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,017
We've got these
shows right here.

74
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:24,217
It's not just
about the tivo.

75
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,483
What? What else
is it about?

76
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,984
"what else is it about?"

77
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:29,917
it's all of it.

78
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:32,084
You can't do anything
like a normal person.

79
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,251
It's about talking
during sex.

80
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,283
So I talk during sex.
So what?

81
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,950
- It's not dirty talk. You chitchat.
- So?

82
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,583
"who can't tell that real
crab isn't fake crab?"

83
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:45,383
by the way, people should be able
to tell real crab from fake crab.

84
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:47,683
You've gotta be a moron if
you can't tell the difference.

85
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:49,084
- That's what I think.
- Well, you know what?

86
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:51,017
If I bring that up
while we're having sex,

87
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:52,950
that's a fun topic
to discuss.

88
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:54,383
You know what
the thing is, larry?

89
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:57,017
People ask me all the time,
"how do you stay with him?"

90
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:59,850
and I always tell them, "there's another
side to larry that you don't see."

91
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:02,483
And then I just realized
today there's no other side.

92
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,617
- No, there's another side.
- There's no other side!

93
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,283
- This is it!
- There's a lot of sides. I'm complex!

94
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:09,784
After I thought
I was gonna die

95
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,917
and you hung up on me,

96
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,483
I started talking
to the guy next to me

97
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,550
and I realized
not everybody's like you.

98
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,117
There are normal people out
there that have conversations.

99
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:22,416
- Oh, the guy next to you.
- Interested in other people.

100
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:26,483
And we had a very...
Soulful conversation...

101
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,583
- That's sweet.
- ... About li... Okay, see?

102
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:30,184
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:32,850
Okay, this guy. Does he carry
mints and a pen and tissues

104
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,184
at all times
like I do, huh?

105
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:37,650
Does he have mints?
How is his breath?

106
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,583
- Very pleasant.
- Really?

107
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,416
- What does he do?
- He owns an underwear company.

108
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:45,251
- Mm-hmm, yes. - oh, an underwear
company. What kind of underwear?

109
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:48,050
He invented...

110
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:49,683
It doesn't matter...

111
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:51,217
Underwear that
doesn't have a fly.

112
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:53,483
No-fly zone?

113
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,784
No-fly zone.

114
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,483
That is
the dumbest company.

115
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,217
What a stupid... I've tried
that underwear. It is so idiotic.

116
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:01,950
You have to drop
the underwear

117
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,217
- to pee, okay?
- I think we just need a little time apart.

118
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:07,283
I'm gonna be
at my sister's.

119
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:09,316
- Don't do this. This is crazy, honey.
- Larry.

120
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,117
What are you doing
this for? What?

121
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:13,950
I love you. How could you
do this? What do you mean?

122
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:16,316
You weren't there
for me when I needed you.

123
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,251
- I couldn't hear you.
- I'll be at becky's.

124
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,884
You're talking
on an airplane phone.

125
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:34,650
Yeah, I didn't think
I was gonna like this.

126
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,184
Usually I don't like
the skin. It's delicious.

127
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:40,650
I marinate it
after I roast it.

128
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:46,217
Cheryl left me.

129
00:05:46,316 --> 00:05:48,784
- What?
- What? What do you mean she left you?

130
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,784
- She's gone. She left.
- Really?

131
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,450
She's gone,
she's out of the house.

132
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,350
- Suitcase... Clothes.
- Oh, she'll come back.

133
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,517
She's with her sister.
She's not coming back.

134
00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:59,050
Do you want something to eat,
sweetie? Let me get you something.

135
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,884
- Jodi, get him a chair, please.
- Oh, sure.

136
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:02,517
- What happened?
- Let me get you a plate.

137
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:05,217
You know, she was coming back on
a plane, and there was a storm,

138
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:09,316
and she called me
from the plane.

139
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,383
And you know, I had the
tivo guy in the house.

140
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:13,517
so?

141
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:16,217
Well, you know, it's so hard
to get the tivo guy, man.

142
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:18,383
This guy would keep exchanging
calls. I can't get him there.

143
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:21,583
So he's finally there,
and the whole call

144
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,884
he's kind of
talking to me, going...

145
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,084
What's with
the small plate?

146
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:29,050
- That's the only one I had clean.
- What?

147
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:31,517
- Such a tiny plate?
- It's the same exact portion. It's just as...

148
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:34,050
- What's the difference?
- It's what my grandmother used to eat from.

149
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:36,717
What happened
with cheryl on the plane?

150
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,984
There was a lot of turbulence.
She was really frightened.

151
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:42,350
The tivo guy was there.
I couldn't really talk,

152
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,151
and... I told her to call
me back in 10 minutes.

153
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,416
- What?
- Oh, larry.

154
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:48,151
The plane's going down,

155
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:49,984
- and you said, "call me back"?
- You can't do that.

156
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:51,884
- You didn't say that.
- I didn't know it was going down!

157
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,884
- Okay okay. All right, you know what?
- I didn't know.

158
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:56,650
She's gonna get over it,
and it's all gonna be okay.

159
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:59,350
No, she's not gonna get over it,
because she met a guy on the plane.

160
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,917
- What? Where did she meet another guy?
- Really?

161
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,151
- On the plane.
- While the plane was going down?

162
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:04,784
- Guy sitting next to her.
- Oh, no.

163
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,683
Guy sitting next to her.

164
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:10,184
What a scumbag. Takes advantage
of a married woman who's scared.

165
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:13,084
I feel terrible. I'm
emotionally distraught over this.

166
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,251
I mean, I know this would
never happen to nan and myself.

167
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,717
- Of course not.
- But I wanna say one thing.

168
00:07:19,784 --> 00:07:22,884
Okay, cheryl's a great girl.

169
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,316
She's adorable,
good cook,

170
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,950
fun to be with.

171
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:28,717
She has a terrific body.

172
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,817
- Used to be amazing.
- I remember.

173
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:35,416
- It's true.
- But let me make my point.

174
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:39,151
None of us at this table
ever would have met cheryl

175
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,650
- if not for larry david.
- That's true.

176
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:43,750
- Very true.
- I brought her into your lives.

177
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,750
Cheryl's a great girl,

178
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,717
but we have
to stick with larry.

179
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,650
People are gonna
take sides now.

180
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,383
Listen, this is a time that
we have to stand behind larry.

181
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:57,850
Hey, that could be cheryl.

182
00:07:57,984 --> 00:07:59,917
You'll get it later. We don't
answer the phone at dinner.

183
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:02,583
- What? I'll answer it.
- No no no. No, the phone is not...

184
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,217
What kind of fucked up
rule is that?

185
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:06,151
- No, we don't answer the phone.
- Get the hell...

186
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:09,050
- What, are you crazy?
- You don't answer the phone. Give me that!

187
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:10,950
Give it to me!

188
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,750
We don't answer the phone
during dinner! It's a rule!

189
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,050
- You jammed my thumb.
- You weren't invited.

190
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:16,650
Go eat somewhere else!

191
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,650
Oh, jesus.

192
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,817
I forgot to cancel
my reservations at primo's.

193
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,750
- I'll use my cell phone.
- Out in the hall,

194
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,316
- not in the kitchen.
- All right, pipe down.

195
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,850
Thank you for calling
primo's. This is iris.

196
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,750
Oh, hi, this is
larry david calling.

197
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:34,450
Oh, hi, Mr. David. We have
you down for 7:30 tonight.

198
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,950
Oh, you know what?

199
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,251
I'm... I'm gonna
have to cancel.

200
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,151
Oh, I'm so sorry.
May I ask why?

201
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:44,950
Well, if you must know,

202
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,683
my wife left me.

203
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:50,683
- Your wife left you.
- Yeah, my wife left me.

204
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:52,784
Okay, Mr. David,
in the future,

205
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,850
it would be nice just to
get a little more notice

206
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,750
- when you wanna cancel a reservation.
- You don't believe me?

207
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:00,583
Sure I believe you.
Your wife left you. Okay.

208
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,383
You know, I'm getting from your
tone that you don't believe me.

209
00:09:02,483 --> 00:09:04,117
You have to cancel.
I understand.

210
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:06,683
I'm just saying that it's our
policy to get a little more notice.

211
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:09,416
Okay, in the future,
if my wife leaves me,

212
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:11,151
i'll make sure she
does it in the morning.

213
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,884
Have a great night.

214
00:09:21,683 --> 00:09:23,517
Maxwells?

215
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,583
- You okay?
- What the hell is this?

216
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:28,884
That's simon's
birthday party.

217
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,316
He's having it
at maxwells?

218
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,483
Big band,
special guest.

219
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,084
- He's going all out.
- Special guest?

220
00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:37,151
Who goes all out for a birthday
party? Like, that's crazy.

221
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:39,850
I thought he was having this in his
house. You know how expensive that is?

222
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,917
I loaned him
$10,000 last month.

223
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:44,316
- Last month?
- Yeah, he said he needed the money.

224
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,884
He needed it to give himself
a birthday party at maxwells!

225
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:49,151
I'm paying
for this thing.

226
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:56,784
- Hey.
- Hi.

227
00:09:56,884 --> 00:09:59,383
I'm sorry. I just came by
to pick up a few more things.

228
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:02,217
Oh. Oh.

229
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:05,583
I'm so glad
you're here,

230
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:08,316
because I...

231
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,050
I need to talk to you.

232
00:10:10,217 --> 00:10:12,517
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

233
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,416
I need you to do
something for me

234
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:16,717
- if iwould be okay.
- Okay.

235
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:19,450
I had to call primo's

236
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,251
- to cancel our reservation.
- Yeah.

237
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,817
And the hostess
asked me

238
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:26,884
why I was canceling,

239
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:29,784
and I told her it was
because you left me.

240
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:31,416
Mm-hmm.

241
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:34,517
But I don't think
she believed me.

242
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:37,884
So what I'd like
you to do

243
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:40,784
is to call the restaurant

244
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:43,251
and just sort of,
you know,

245
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,316
confirm my story.

246
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,550
You want me to call a
stranger at a restaurant

247
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,784
and talk to them
about our marriage

248
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:55,617
well, she's not really a
stranger. Iris, you know iris.

249
00:10:55,717 --> 00:10:58,050
- The hostess. She works there.
- I don't really know iris.

250
00:10:58,151 --> 00:10:59,517
You know the one.
She's got the long hair.

251
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,984
I know who you're
talking about,

252
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:03,084
but I really don't
think I want to call her

253
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:06,151
and tell her
that we're breaking up.

254
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:08,084
You know, she said
she believed me,

255
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:11,151
but there was
something in her tone

256
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:14,517
that told me that maybe she thought
I was making this up or something.

257
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:15,984
I mean, who would
go to the lengths

258
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:18,850
of saying that their
wife split up with them

259
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:21,617
- and that's why they had to cancel?
- You would.

260
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,084
Not so sure about that.
I don't think I would.

261
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:29,251
Yeah well, excuse me. I
gotta actually get this stuff.

262
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,984
Cheryl, don't go.
Come on.

263
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:36,184
Come on, just stay.
Don't, don't.

264
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,884
I need to go, larry.

265
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,350
Will youall
the restaurant?

266
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,817
- Hey, larry.
- Hey, simon.

267
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:01,817
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

268
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:04,084
- Good good, good good.
- You know,

269
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:06,151
I was over at jeff's,

270
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:08,450
and I noticed the
invitation to your party.

271
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,450
Aren't the invitations great?
I took a lot of time on that.

272
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,784
I had no idea the party
was gonna be at maxwell's

273
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:14,817
- with the open bar...
- Open bar.

274
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,350
...and the band,
and the special guests.

275
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,717
Wait till you hear about
the special guest. Yeah.

276
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:21,817
I loaned you
$10,000 a month ago.

277
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:24,184
You didn't tell me you were
having this big party for yourself.

278
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:26,350
$10,000 has nothing
to do with the party.

279
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,050
- Well, what are you talking about?
- No no no no.

280
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:29,650
I'm not using that money
for that. I'm using the money

281
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,117
- for something else. And I appreciate it.
- I know,

282
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,550
but you would have to use
the money for something else

283
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,383
if you didn't
have this party.

284
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:36,450
- You could have used the money for that.
- Don't connect the two,

285
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,650
- because they... Don't think of them as...
- Well, I see them

286
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:40,650
- as being totally connected.
- No, they're not connected at all.

287
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,184
No, have nothing
to do with each other.

288
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:45,984
Simon, you're crazy,
you know?

289
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:49,084
Anyway, all right,
so fine.

290
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:50,817
- Yeah.
- I'll see you at maxwells.

291
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:52,450
This is probably
gonna be some party.

292
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,917
Umm, okay,
here's the thing:

293
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:57,450
cheryl is
gonna be there.

294
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,984
Are you comfortable
with that?

295
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:02,583
I'm comfortable.

296
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:06,283
I don't think anybody else
will be... Comfortable.

297
00:13:06,383 --> 00:13:08,583
Well, they're
gonna have to...

298
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,784
It's their problem,
isn't it, you know?

299
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:13,383
Here's the thing... My
wife and I talked about it,

300
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,017
and... We chose cheryl.

301
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,184
Believe this guy?

302
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:23,984
$10,000 I loan him.

303
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:26,717
Disinvites me from the
party, choosing cheryl.

304
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:29,017
I'm paying for that party.
You know that? Hey, zev.

305
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,750
- Hello, larry david.
- You're cleaning your underwear and socks?

306
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:34,517
That's another thing... I gotta
go back to fluff and fold now.

307
00:13:34,617 --> 00:13:37,683
Alana didn't show up. You know,
I don't have her phone number.

308
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,117
Cheryl took care
of all that stuff.

309
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:40,550
You're just lost,
aren't you?

310
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,850
- I'm completely lost.
- Oh my god.

311
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:45,217
You know what I got
in my foyer at home?

312
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:47,450
Pictures of all
my dry cleaners.

313
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,217
Hey, xena
the warrior princess.

314
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:55,050
Yeah.

315
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:56,884
- Did you use to watch that show?
- Of course.

316
00:13:57,017 --> 00:14:00,416
- Yeah, she's pretty sexy.
- Oh, my...

317
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:03,251
What the hell, larry?

318
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:05,151
Oh my god. I'm so sorry.

319
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:09,350
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, shit.

320
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,884
- It's ripped.
- She doesn't come in anymore.

321
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,817
How am I gonna
get another picture?

322
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:15,050
Man.

323
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:17,151
You can get lucy lawless's
picture, can't you?

324
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:18,583
You know what? I'll
get ahold of her agent

325
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:20,084
and we'll find it.
I'll get it.

326
00:14:20,217 --> 00:14:21,583
Okay, I'll get you
another picture.

327
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:24,884
Could you have her make
it out to "zev" this time?

328
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,884
- Yes. Okay.
- Thank you. All right.

329
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:28,617
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

330
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:30,151
Just give me
the picture.

331
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:33,850
- I'll get the picture.
- Thank you so much.

332
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,984
Please take this
couple over to table #24.

333
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,117
Thanks,
have a nice dinner.

334
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,450
What's taking so long,
may I ask?

335
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,784
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. David.
We're just really full tonight.

336
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:52,450
It should just be
a couple more minutes.

337
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,717
Let me ask you
a question.

338
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:57,251
- Did my wife call the restaurant?
- No.

339
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,184
Is that why I'm not getting a table?

340
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,517
Because you didn't
believe my breakup story

341
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:03,717
- last night?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

342
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,350
- I think you do know what I'm talking about.
- No, we're just full tonight.

343
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,316
- Why would I make that up? That's insane.
- Mr. David,

344
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,583
- we'll be right with you.
- You have to be insane to make up a story like that.

345
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:12,483
- Okay.
- If I wanted to cancel a reservation,

346
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,984
and needed an excuse, I would
just say I'm sick or something.

347
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:15,884
Primo's,
this is iris.

348
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:18,283
Sure, come right in.

349
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:20,450
You know, we did break up. That's
why I had to cancel the reservation.

350
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,984
Okay, we'll
see you soon.

351
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:29,450
You totally deserve that.

352
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,084
You totally deserve it.
Yes, you do.

353
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:34,550
On no planet is a
shoe caddy a good gift.

354
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,316
That's just a...
What?

355
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,084
All right, yeah,
no no no,

356
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:40,416
I get that
it was payback, but...

357
00:15:40,517 --> 00:15:43,084
It's not long distance
even if it's in india.

358
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:44,617
So I'm on
the 14th hole, okay?

359
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:46,450
Lloyd, he's got these
great cuban cigars.

360
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:48,151
- What? I can't talk to you, mom.
- So we're smoking these cigars.

361
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:50,017
- I've got someone on the other line.
- So I reach down

362
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,817
- to take a puff...
- I can't hear you. It's loud in here.

363
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,884
- No no, just call them.
- ... And all of a sudden, lloyd goes,

364
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:56,283
- "what the fuck are you doing? That's my cigar!"
- I'll call you back.

365
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,550
- Call them.
- So I was trying to brush my teeth with an apple.

366
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,717
- It was horrible, horrible.
- Excuse me.

367
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:03,717
Who are you talking to?

368
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:06,450
- I'm talking to myself.
- Well, you're doing it really loud.

369
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,450
- Oh, really?
- Yeah yeah.

370
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,283
- You're kind of talking loud yourself.
- To a person.

371
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,717
- What's the difference?
- I'm actually conversing with another human being.

372
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:16,316
- Oh, really?
- Very different than just...

373
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,251
To the outside observer, it's
the same level of annoyance.

374
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,151
Well, I need to talk to my
friend. I can barely hear here.

375
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:22,184
Okay, well, maybe if you
talk lower to your friend,

376
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,550
- I'll talk lower to my other self.
- Great great.

377
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,717
- Yeah, good plan.
- Okay, all right.

378
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,717
Jesus christ. I'm literally
sitting minding my own business...

379
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:29,283
What a schmuck. He's been talking
on his phone the whole dinner.

380
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:31,117
...and this guy is talking to
himself. He's still doing it.

381
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:32,483
Do you hear that?
Listen, you hear this?

382
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,184
He doesn't even think
he's being annoying.

383
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:35,650
He thinks he can just sit there
and tk out loud not be annoying.

384
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,617
Do you hear that?
He's literally just doing it

385
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:39,383
- just to be annoying.
- He's been driving me nuts the last 10 minutes.

386
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:41,184
Honestly, I'm done anyway.
This is bullshit.

387
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:42,917
- I'm paying. I don't care.
- No, can you hear him?

388
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:44,617
No, he's still talking. Wait,
I got steve on the other line.

389
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:46,450
- He wins, he wins. Yeah, you win.
- Hey, steve...

390
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,984
- Good for you, being annoying.
- ... Do me a favor.

391
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:50,450
Remind me... These
people, they're just...

392
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:55,984
- Who are you talking to?
- Oh, hey.

393
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:58,483
- Hi, jodi.
- Hey.

394
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:01,483
What are you doing
tomorrow? Let's play golf.

395
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:05,450
I can't. Larry, the funkhousers
have made a decision.

396
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,483
We're going with cheryl.

397
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:11,184
Yeah.

398
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:28,650
- Oh. Hi, becky.
- Oh. Hi.

399
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:30,850
Is cheryl here?

400
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,583
No, she's not here
right now, so...

401
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:37,850
- You know when she'll be
back? - nuh-uh, I don't,

402
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:40,717
- but it was good to see you.
- Alana?

403
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:43,850
- Is that alana?
- Mr. Larry.

404
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:47,017
What are you doing here?

405
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:48,917
I work for Mrs. Cheryl.

406
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:52,217
- You chose cheryl?
- Yes.

407
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:54,450
Hey, becky?

408
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,650
Oh, I wasn't sure if you'd still
be here. I thought you were gonna...

409
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,017
I am, and...

410
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:02,984
- Hi.
- Hi.

411
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:04,483
This is glenn.
This is larry.

412
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,650
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

413
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:11,050
Nice head of hair.

414
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:14,383
Okay. What are
you doing here?

415
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:15,950
You need to call
ted danson back.

416
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,683
He wanted to invite you
to an oceans fundraiser.

417
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,383
Oh, yeah.
Okay, thanks.

418
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:22,917
- You'll like ted.
- I like the ocean.

419
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:25,184
Then it's perfect.
- I'm very pro-ocean.

420
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:28,450
- So glenn, how's the no-fly
underwear business doing? - great.

421
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,950
- I told him about your business.
- Yeah.

422
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:31,583
- It's going great.
- Is it?

423
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,917
- Yeah.
- You think men want an underwear

424
00:18:34,017 --> 00:18:35,984
- that has no fly?
- I know they do.

425
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:39,050
74% of the men we
tested go over the fence.

426
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,683
- Oh, they do?
- Yeah, the rest go through the gate.

427
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:43,316
- Well...
- You're not giving people an option.

428
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,917
The penis needs an option,
just like everybody else.

429
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:48,483
The penis is human.
It needs an option.

430
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,784
All right, well you
should probably get going.

431
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,917
- Okay.
- Okay.

432
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:56,050
- Mint?
- No.

433
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:59,583
- Tissue?
- No, I...

434
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:05,683
Pen?

435
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,416
- Is that glenn with two "n"s?
- It is, in fact.

436
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:16,517
You know what? I wouldn't care...

437
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:18,517
I wouldn't care if she
left me for a bald guy.

438
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,316
Right.

439
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:24,050
- But this is, like, the worst betrayal.
- What does he look like?

440
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:27,750
- Thick, like presidential kennedy hair.
- Oh.

441
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,316
- And he makes underwear?
- Yeah, no-fly underwear,

442
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,750
like there's some great
clamoring for no-fly underwear.

443
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,416
- Who needs no-fly
underwear? - I know.

444
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:36,416
A guy who goes into a store and
goes, "i need a pair of underwear.

445
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:38,283
- I got a vagina."
- I know.

446
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:40,017
No-fly underwear.

447
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:42,184
Hello?
Hold on one second.

448
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:47,251
Great, thank you
so very much.

449
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,950
Really, thank him.
Thanks, bye.

450
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,984
Here you go.

451
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,050
Lucy lawless.

452
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,517
oh.
Oh, yeah.

453
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:58,316
Oh, thanks.

454
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,750
- Let me call her.
- Which water is mine?

455
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,416
I don't know.
I took one sip.

456
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,251
I have no...

457
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:08,416
- We'll have to get more.
- We'll get more water.

458
00:20:10,517 --> 00:20:12,617
- "To zev... "
- zev, yes.

459
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:15,450
- "... Lucy lawless."
- Thank you so much.

460
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,117
I not only get you
the picture,

461
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,483
I get you lucy lawless.

462
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,617
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

463
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:23,850
- Wow, you make lovely "l"s.
- You got my dry cleaning?

464
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:25,717
Tomorrow after 5:00.

465
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:33,383
- Hey, that was so nice of you to do that.
- Oh, you're welcome.

466
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:35,717
To tell you the truth, I thought
he was gonna be more bowled over

467
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,817
by your presence.
He took it pretty calmly.

468
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:41,084
- People are always expecting someone bigger.
- I used to be very intimidated

469
00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:42,917
- by that warrior princess, I gotta tell you.
- Did you really?

470
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:44,450
- Yes.
- And now?

471
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:45,984
Now that I see you
in person,

472
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:48,084
- I actually think
I can take you.

473
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,950
Look, I'm not a cool guy
or anything, okay?

474
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:54,850
I haven't been
on a date in 12 years,

475
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:57,217
but I would love to waste
your time for couple of hours.

476
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,850
- What do you think
about that?

477
00:20:58,984 --> 00:21:00,750
Can I do that?
Is that possible?

478
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,617
- How about that?
- Okay, yeah.

479
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,850
- Have you been to primo's?
- I have never been to primo's.

480
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:06,550
- I hear that it's great though.
- It's really good.

481
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,483
All right, yeah. Well,
you've got my number.

482
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,817
I do.

483
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:12,184
- Well...
- Oh, jeez.

484
00:21:12,283 --> 00:21:14,450
- Wh?
- Ted danson.

485
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,550
He is an asshole.

486
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,383
Really? You don't like him?

487
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:21,450
- I despise him. He's just terrible.
- Hey, how are you?

488
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,984
- Hi.
- How are you doing, man?

489
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:24,416
- You know lucy lawless?
- I do.

490
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,817
- Yeah, we met.
- Ted danson.

491
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,950
- Yeah, nice to see you.
- You too.

492
00:21:29,084 --> 00:21:30,850
- Well, okay.
- All right.

493
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,917
Bye.

494
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:36,117
What is that?
"call me"?

495
00:21:36,217 --> 00:21:37,550
- Did she just do a "call me"?
- Yeah, she did.

496
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,717
- We're going out to dinner.
- Really?

497
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:41,550
- Yes, yeah.
- Well, good for you.

498
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,583
I asked her for a date.
Here's what I said.

499
00:21:43,717 --> 00:21:46,217
"i'm not really
a cool guy or anything,"

500
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:47,984
which is a pretty
good line I thought.

501
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:51,017
I never did that when I was dating,
admit that I wasn't a cool guy.

502
00:21:51,117 --> 00:21:53,483
Now I didn't give a shit. I
just said, "i'm not a cool guy."

503
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,050
It fucking worked! "i'm not a cool
guy"! I'm gonna use it all the time.

504
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:59,017
- Good for you, man, really.
- Thank you.

505
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,784
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you deserve that.

506
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:03,683
- I gotta scoot.
- Wait, let me ask you something.

507
00:22:05,017 --> 00:22:07,117
How come I wasn't invited
to your fundraiser?

508
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:11,050
- Wha-what fundraiser?
- The oceans fundraiser.

509
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:14,583
Oh! I thought you were
a global-warming guy.

510
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,084
- Really?
- Yeah.

511
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:19,650
You're going with cheryl,
aren't you?

512
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,650
Yeah. Yeah.

513
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,750
"okay, what is jim
jones's most famous song?"

514
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,850
- "ballin"!
- And there he is, y'all!

515
00:22:45,283 --> 00:22:46,784
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.
- And a la-di-da.

516
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:49,583
- Not too much? Not too dressy?
- No.

517
00:22:49,683 --> 00:22:51,017
- No, you look good.
- You're cool, man. You're cool.

518
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:52,383
You're bringing it tonight,
man. Let me tell you something.

519
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:54,117
What, am I gonna sit home?
She's going out.

520
00:22:54,217 --> 00:22:56,483
- That's right.
- She's got a new boyfriend already!

521
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,917
- Your turn.
- By the way, guess who I'm going out with?

522
00:22:59,017 --> 00:23:00,583
- Who?
- Who are you going out with?

523
00:23:00,717 --> 00:23:03,117
Xena the warrior
princess.

524
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,383
- Ooh!
- Wait a second now.

525
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:07,517
- What?
- Uh-huh.

526
00:23:07,617 --> 00:23:09,316
- Do you love that?
- I love it!

527
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,151
- Don't wait up.
- Don't worry, we won't.

528
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:13,650
- My man l.d.
- Yeah.

529
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,050
Sorry you gotta miss
that lakers game.

530
00:23:15,217 --> 00:23:16,884
- Forget about it.
- Oh, I got to tivo it.

531
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,683
What?

532
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,383
- What the hell?
- Larry, you all right?

533
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,050
- You all right?
- Leon, go help him.

534
00:23:24,151 --> 00:23:26,050
- What happened?
- What happened, man?

535
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:28,683
- You all right?
- What's the matter?

536
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:31,583
So what's the deal?

537
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,650
- Yeah, what's the deal?
- I was just about to explain.

538
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,483
Based on your signs
and symptoms,

539
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,583
when you twisted
your body,

540
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:40,717
your testicles got ensnared
in the fly of your underwear,

541
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,717
which acted like a noose.

542
00:23:42,784 --> 00:23:45,984
And it caused scrotal
hematoma and contusion.

543
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,617
- Twisted balls.
- In layman's terms, yes,

544
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,316
but it's not
as bad as it sounds.

545
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,483
It's a bruising, which will
probably last about a week or so.

546
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,950
Oh, okay.
- But I would definitely recommend

547
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,483
switching to a style
of underwear with no fly.

548
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,650
- No-fly zone? Is that what you're
telling me? - that's exactly it.

549
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,583
No-fly zone.
That's a popular brand.

550
00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:05,050
- I'm not wearing that underwear, okay?
- You gotta do it, man.

551
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:07,750
You got long balls, larry.
Long balls.

552
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,416
- You got long-ass balls.
- I've got long balls?

553
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,350
Doctor, you've seen
his balls, right?

554
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,050
Would you say my balls
were unusually long?

555
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,617
They're a bit more distended
than the average testicles.

556
00:24:15,717 --> 00:24:17,084
You got long-ass
balls, larry.

557
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:18,984
Long-ball larry.
That's your new name.

558
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:20,950
Long balls.
Who the hell knew?

559
00:24:21,017 --> 00:24:24,050
Long balls.
Change the draws.

560
00:24:24,151 --> 00:24:27,117
Okay, fine.
I'll wear the no-fly zone.

561
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:30,050
- Hey, thanks for getting me through this so fast.
- Yeah, my pleasure.

562
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:32,617
You know what, I got a date.
I gotta get out of here.

563
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,483
Oh yeah, speaking of that, you're
gonna wanna ice your testicles,

564
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,784
and no sex for
at least a week.

565
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:40,750
I don't think that's gonna be
a problem for me, but thanks.

566
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,217
Thanks for the info.
All right.

567
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:44,184
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

568
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:46,084
My man.

569
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,316
- I got long balls.
- Long-ass balls.

570
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:55,717
I've actually trained my body
not to use public toilets.

571
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:57,050
Trained it.

572
00:24:57,151 --> 00:24:59,450
So I never ever have to go
when I'm out of my house.

573
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,984
Yeah, I'm getting
a red flag here, larry.

574
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,850
You know what? We should switch
sides. Because the game's on.

575
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,350
- I don't wanna look at it.
- Why not?

576
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,884
Because I'm tivoing it.

577
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,884
- Oh, hate spoilers, right?
- I can't watch it if I know what happens.

578
00:25:10,984 --> 00:25:14,884
- So what else about you?
- I'm a man of mystery.

579
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:18,184
- And you're a jew, right?
- Yeah.

580
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,184
- 'Cause we don't have those where I come from.
- Really?

581
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:22,251
- Nope.
- So I must be quite fascinating to you.

582
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,984
You are so exotic
you have no idea.

583
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:25,184
- Really?
- Yeah.

584
00:25:25,283 --> 00:25:26,683
It's like a black man
in sweden.

585
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,817
- It's exactly like that.
- Right?

586
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:30,984
Mr. Akivo, your table's
ready. Right this way please.

587
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:32,984
Sorry for the wait.

588
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:35,517
Okay, we were definitely
here ahead of them.

589
00:25:35,683 --> 00:25:37,050
- Absolutely.
- Huh, were we not?

590
00:25:37,151 --> 00:25:39,450
- Uh-huh. - I'm gonna
talk to the owner.

591
00:25:39,517 --> 00:25:41,217
Hey, primo.

592
00:25:41,316 --> 00:25:43,084
Mr. David, good evening.

593
00:25:43,217 --> 00:25:45,450
What's going on? All these
people I came in ahead of

594
00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:47,650
are getting seated. How
come I'm not getting a table?

595
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,750
Mr. David,

596
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,917
there is no table.

597
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:57,817
No table? How come? What
do you mean "no table"?

598
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:01,884
We chose cheryl.

599
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:13,917
Oh my god. I'm so sorry.
Can you believe that?

600
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:15,416
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

601
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:18,350
- Mint?
- Yeah.

602
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:25,884
- Tissue?
- No.

603
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,583
So what do you
wanna do now?

604
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:32,416
We could go
to my house.

605
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:35,050
Your house?

606
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:38,050
Sure. It's just
up the road.

607
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:42,217
Oh, right.

608
00:26:42,316 --> 00:26:44,217
What?

609
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:47,050
My testicles got ensnared
in the fly of my underwear,

610
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:50,850
and the doctor said I
can't have sex for a week.

611
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,650
But we can
go there for dinner.

612
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,450
I was only talking about
dinner, you big asshole.

613
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,984
No! No!

614
00:27:20,383 --> 00:27:22,117
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Hey, name please.

615
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:24,550
- Larry david. Simon's party, right?
- Yes.

616
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,683
- Cool.
- Sorry, you're not on the list.

617
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,950
That's gotta be a mistake. I gotta
be on this list. I'm a close friend.

618
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:32,416
- My wife is in there.
- You're not on the list. I can't let you in.

619
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,217
- Come on, man. I'll give you $20.
- $20?

620
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,050
If you're not on the list,
I can't let you in. Sorry.

621
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:38,251
- $40.
- That's insulting.

622
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:41,050
Hey.

623
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:43,050
What the heck
are you doing here?

624
00:27:43,151 --> 00:27:44,683
You're invited?

625
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:46,383
No, he didn't invite me.
I have a gig.

626
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:48,683
He's paying me $10,000 to do
a set. It's a piece of cake.

627
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:50,884
- Are you the special guest?
- Yeah, so what?

628
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:52,483
- What's the big deal?
- Are you kidding?

629
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,750
- It's $10,000.
- He's giving you $10,000?

630
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,050
- Yeah, so what?
- So what?! That's my money.

631
00:27:57,151 --> 00:27:58,950
I'm paying for you.
You're my money.

632
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,750
- What do you mean I'm your money?
- Don't you understand?

633
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,350
I gave him $10,000. He's
giving it to you, so I own you!

634
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,984
This is not san quentin.
I have a gig for christ...

635
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,617
I don't care.
You're not going in!

636
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:08,350
Why are you taking this so
personally?! This is just business!

637
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,984
No, it's not business.
What are you doing?

638
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:11,683
- You're not going in there.
- I am going in there.

639
00:28:11,784 --> 00:28:13,251
- Don't tell me what to do.
- You're not going in.

640
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,251
- Hey, what's your...
Oh, come on.

641
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,251
I hit you in the thigh, you big baby.

642
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,850
Long balls.

643
00:28:18,984 --> 00:28:21,350
- Long balls.
- Long balls.
