00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:25,350
- Hey, Larry.
- Hi, Cha Cha.

5
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:27,716
Thanks again for
recommending me for this job.

6
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:31,616
- Thanks. You were so great.
- Oh. Good.

7
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:33,551
And Richard says
thank you too.

8
00:00:34,883 --> 00:00:36,950
- Aren't these great?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:38,551
You like 'em?
I could get you a pair.

10
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:40,683
Nah, that's okay.
I'm going to the bathroom.

11
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:43,084
It's like Ross down by the
airport-- They don't do just clothes.

12
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:44,817
They do housewares too,
if you're interested.

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,683
- That's okay. I'll-- I'll--
- So how are you today?

14
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:50,683
- Good. I'm just going to the bathroom.
- Yeah? Is that Prada?

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,817
- Hey, Larry.
- Oh, hey, Burt.

16
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:55,917
- 1:00 lunch, right?
- Yeah, 1:00.

17
00:00:56,017 --> 00:00:57,551
Yeah, lunch
with the wives.

18
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,817
Downstairs, yeah.
see you then.

19
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:01,750
- He's great, isn't he?
- He is a good guy, yeah.

20
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:03,284
I wanna be a producer. How
do you become a producer?

21
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:05,350
You know,
you gotta know people.

22
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:08,250
- Well, I know you.
- You know me, yeah. That's true. Okay.

23
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,983
- Maybe we could talk about that sometime over lunch.
- Yeah, sure.

24
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:14,284
Great. Okay.
just let me know when...

25
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:17,250
- All right, okay.
- ...And I'll write it in my filofax.

26
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:32,451
Wow, that was quick.

27
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:38,184
You don't really need
to comment

28
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:41,150
on what's going on

29
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,817
- In terms of that or anything.
- Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

30
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:47,017
- Okay.
- By the way, how do you get here in the morning?

31
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:50,017
I'm having a hard time getting
here on time. What if we carpooled?

32
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:53,050
I really gotta get back,
okay? So...

33
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,084
Okay, maybe you could
think about it and...

34
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:58,583
Yeah, we're not-- we probably
won't be able to work that out,

35
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:00,384
but I'll--
we'll think about it.

36
00:02:00,484 --> 00:02:02,117
You have one of those
healthy cars.

37
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:04,117
How does it work?

38
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:06,716
You put your foot
on the gas.

39
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:11,484
It was like having
a bathroom monitor.

40
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:13,650
- I have a bathroom monitor.
- oh, that's terrible.

41
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,650
Why don't you go at home,
like I do?

42
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,350
I don't like
to go in my house.

43
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:19,017
Who doesn't like
to go in their house?

44
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:21,883
Cheryl has-- you know,
she's an environmentalist.

45
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:23,883
She has this recycled

46
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:25,917
post-consumer toilet paper
all over the house.

47
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:28,084
- Oh.
- It's coarse.

48
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:29,883
It's like going
to the port authority

49
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,950
- Or a whaling vessel.
- A whaling vessel!

50
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:35,750
I can't go here and I can't
go there. It's horrible.

51
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,451
Oh, jeez.

52
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:40,017
All right,
let's go to lunch.

53
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,817
I love that you have a
restaurant in your building.

54
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:46,650
- Oh, and Larry...
- Mmm.

55
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,950
Again, I want to thank you
for Cha Cha.

56
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:50,650
- That has worked out very well.
- What?

57
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,917
- Cha Cha. She's been wonderful.
- oh my god, Cha Cha?

58
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:54,917
- Cha Cha's been wonderful.
- Are you kidding me?

59
00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:56,917
I apologize for having
even recommended her.

60
00:02:57,017 --> 00:02:59,484
- No no.
- You don't have to lie to me.

61
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:01,284
Okay? You don't
have to lie to me.

62
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:03,551
No, I wouldn't. No, she's
worked out very well.

63
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,783
- No, she's terrible.
- Better than expected.

64
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,850
She's terrible and if you
want to fire her, go ahead.

65
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,484
Oh, right.
no no.

66
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,217
- Don't keep her on my account, okay?
- I won't.

67
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:13,284
You're not gonna hurt my
feelings if you fire her.

68
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:15,050
We're very happy with her.
what can I say?

69
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:17,050
I've noticed that
every time

70
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:19,050
I pass your office--
that she's not working,

71
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:22,317
that she's reading or talking
on the phone. By the way--

72
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:25,217
well, that's her job. She's
supposed to-- she's a receptionist.

73
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:29,017
She's supposed to use
obscenities every other word,

74
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:32,750
say "fuck" and "fuck this,
cunt that" the whole time?

75
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,551
- You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not kidding.

76
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,017
- The "c" word?
- It's true, I swear.

77
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,417
Oh, she's been very--
she really came along

78
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:41,783
at a good time
for all of us.

79
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:43,883
I am very impressed, Barbara,
that you are here today.

80
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:45,917
- Oh, thank you. Me too.
- They've got nine kids.

81
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,050
- Nine kids? Nine kids?
- Yeah. Yeah.

82
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,217
- Nine kids? That's unbelievable.
- I know.

83
00:03:50,384 --> 00:03:52,350
Jesus, you're kidding.

84
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,417
It's a little egotistical
though, isn't it...

85
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:56,417
No, it's really
not up to us.

86
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,417
...To have
so many of you?

87
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:00,683
You want to bring so much
more of you into the world.

88
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:03,451
Hey hey hey, you should tell
Larry about your dad's shop.

89
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,683
Oh, my dad has opened
this barbershop.

90
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,017
He wants you both to come,
special invitation.

91
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:10,484
Completely retro,
very old-school.

92
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,983
- You mean, like the old barbershops?
- Oh yeah, with the pole.

93
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,783
I love that.
what a great idea.

94
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:16,850
- The first thing he did was get the pole.
- I'm gonna go.

95
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,783
- I'm gonna go with you.
- does he do the hot towels?

96
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,017
- Should we go to the barbershop?
- I'm with you. Let's go.

97
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:23,250
- We're gonna go.
- yeah, get a cut and a shave.

98
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:26,384
- A little aqua velva?
- Like "the godfather."

99
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:28,150
I hope that you
enjoyed your lunch.

100
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:29,683
Daviday,
it was fantastic.

101
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:31,150
Good.
I want to let you know

102
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:33,017
that we are going to send
our autumn food jellies

103
00:04:33,117 --> 00:04:35,917
made of concentrated
sugar, apricots

104
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:37,783
and winter fruits
and nuts.

105
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,783
- Oh, delicious.
- Winter fruits.

106
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:41,750
- A nice treat, a nice treat.
- Yummy.

107
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,616
Now tell me, is there
anything else I can do for you?

108
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,217
You know what? You could wrap
this up for me to take home.

109
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:49,050
Very good. You're going to warm
that up for a nice luncheon?

110
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,117
Uh, no, actually.
it's for the dog.

111
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:55,150
We have a policy
that we do not give food

112
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,983
that was prepared for people to animals.

113
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,883
Well, I'm giving this
to the dog. You're not.

114
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:02,117
So just wrap it up.
I'll give it to the dog.

115
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,117
No, that is the policy
of the restaurant.

116
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:06,117
All right, daviday,
forget I said it.

117
00:05:06,217 --> 00:05:08,683
Just wrap it up. I'm
taking it home. Okay?

118
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:11,484
We do not give
doggy bags to dogs.

119
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,417
Why do you think they call
it a goddamn doggy bag, huh?

120
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:16,217
If you want to feed an
animal, why don't you

121
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,350
go to petco
and get a bag of kibble?

122
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,917
Well, I give him kibble
and I like to spice it up

123
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:23,517
- With a little steak every now and then.
- I can bring you corn.

124
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:25,983
- I don't want corn. This is my steak.
- okay, you know what?

125
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:27,150
- Hey hey hey.
- What?

126
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,850
You know what?
I'm gonna take that home.

127
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,050
- Oh, okay.
- Do you mind? Do you mind?

128
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,417
- You take it home.
- Daviday, I'm gonna take this home.

129
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:38,250
- Do you have an animal?
- No.

130
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,250
- Does he have an animal?
- No.

131
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,950
So you are going
to eat that?

132
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,050
Yes.

133
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,117
- You promise me?
- Yeah.

134
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,917
We shall see.

135
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:58,084
- A fucking nutjob.
- "We shall see"?

136
00:05:58,184 --> 00:06:00,716
- What does that mean?
-It's a little crazy

137
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:02,817
that you can't give
a doggy bag to a dog.

138
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,451
- It's none of their business.
- Thank you. Thank you.

139
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,883
- All right, I'm going to the bathroom.
- All right.

140
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:10,050
You're excused.

141
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:15,716
Hey, Larry.
long time no see.

142
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,417
- Hey, Cha Cha.
- Hey.

143
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:19,350
- Have you had the fruit plate here?
- No.

144
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:21,250
- It's excellent.
- Really?

145
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,417
- You have to try it. Taste this.
- No, please.

146
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,650
- It's the ripest cantaloupe.
- I've had fruit. Fruit's fruit pretty much.

147
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:29,350
What did you have
for lunch?

148
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:30,883
- I had some chicken.
- chicken?

149
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:33,517
Chicken and fruit go together.
you can have this for dessert.

150
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:35,417
- Okay, I gotta--
- It's really really good.

151
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:36,917
I highly recommend it.

152
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:39,184
Mm, that time again, huh?

153
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,551
-Oh, cool, you're here. I owe you.
- oh, hey.

154
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,451
Good to see you, man. I
was just over at Cha Cha's.

155
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:04,084
Ooh, god, is she beautifu whew. Jesus.

156
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:06,917
Listen, I had an idea. I want
to go to a movie tomorrow night

157
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:09,084
and maybe-- it's been a
while-- let's double-date,

158
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:10,883
Cha Cha and me
and you and Cheryl.

159
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:13,084
What do you think?

160
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,451
- Uh...
- Why the hesitation?

161
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:18,184
I don't know. I mean, I
don't know what our plans are.

162
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:19,883
I'll let you know.
I'll call you.

163
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:22,084
What's wrong?

164
00:07:23,983 --> 00:07:26,917
You know, I got Cha Cha
this job and all...

165
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:29,050
Yeah, and she loves you
for it. Me too, by the way.

166
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,850
Yeah, well, it's not really
working out for me,

167
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,350
I gotta tell you.

168
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:35,084
Why not?

169
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:37,017
Her office is right across
from the bathroom.

170
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:39,616
- Yeah, I know.
- Every time I go to the bathroom

171
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:43,384
I have to have this--
stop and chat with her

172
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:47,517
both before I go and
after I go. It's too much.

173
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:49,716
She means well.
by the way, she's told me

174
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:53,184
that you go to the bathroom,
like, 10 to 14 times a day.

175
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,650
You move your bowels,
you piss...

176
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:57,417
Are you all right?
she was concerned.

177
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:59,451
Okay, do you see
what I'm saying?

178
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:02,284
This is what I'm talking about.
this is none of her business--

179
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:04,017
how often I go
to the bathroom,

180
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,551
what I'm doing in there,
how long I'm in there.

181
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,284
Talking to you about my
personal bathroom habits--

182
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:12,184
that's not good, all right?
it's too much. It's too much.

183
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,217
Someone's got to sit there. Would you
rather have a klansman sitting there?

184
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:18,484
No, I'd rather have a stranger,
frankly-- a stranger sitting there

185
00:08:18,551 --> 00:08:20,750
who I don't have to
report into.

186
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,983
- She cares about you.
- Oh, she cares about me?

187
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:25,817
- Yeah.
- Okay, listen, it's none of her business.

188
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:27,650
She has bowel concern
for you and I do too.

189
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,551
I don't need
her bowel concern.

190
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,084
- How much water do you drink?
- I drink a lot of water, that's all.

191
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:34,250
- Big deal.
- A lot of water? You drink more than a porpoise.

192
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,250
Yeah, usually I have
bottles of water.

193
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,683
- I don't know where they are.
- no one pisses that often

194
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:40,750
without drinking, like,
thousands of gallons a week.

195
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,750
Okay, all right, let's stop
talking about this.

196
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,551
My bathroom habits are not
your concern, okay?

197
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,817
All right, I won't care
about your health. Fine.

198
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:49,750
You don't need to care about--
I'm in very good health.

199
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,750
- You are?
- I got a beautiful colon.

200
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,117
- You wanna take a picture of my colon?
- I have a vhs of mine.

201
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:56,217
Fine. You can put my colon
up next to your colon.

202
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,384
We'll see who's got
a cleaner, healthier colon.

203
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,284
I'll have a colon contest
with you any time you want.

204
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:01,983
Any time you want to have
a colon contest, buddy, yeah.

205
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:04,384
You're shitting and pissing
almost 70 times a week.

206
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:06,750
Get the hell out of here.
this is ridiculous.

207
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,284
She's right next to you.

208
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:10,284
I don't want her
monitoring

209
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,484
my bathroom habits,
okay?

210
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,484
What are you eating?
a lot of grains

211
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,484
and fruit and nuts
like a jew squirrel?

212
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,650
- Okay.
- where are you going?

213
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,317
You're not going
to the bathroom again?

214
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:22,850
No, I'm not going
to the bathroom.

215
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,384
- You are going to the bathroom.
- No.

216
00:09:24,484 --> 00:09:26,150
I bet you are
going to the bathroom.

217
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:23,017
So what happened?

218
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,616
I flushed a toilet
and it was, like,

219
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:28,451
the loudest flush, like
a sonic boom went off.

220
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:32,417
- It just was so loud that I was thrown back.
- really?

221
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:34,417
I was trapped
inside the stall

222
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:36,517
and I'm telling you,
it's killing me.

223
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:38,817
Okay, so you're having
some pain there.

224
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:40,451
- Right ear, yeah.
- Right ear, okay.

225
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:42,583
Let me just ask you
a couple other questions.

226
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,250
Are you experiencing
any dizziness?

227
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,950
- No.
- No.

228
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,217
- Any shortness of breath?
- No.

229
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:50,217
- Aches and pains anywhere else?
- No.

230
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,117
Are you going
to the bathroom a lot?

231
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:56,917
I don't see how that's
relevant, really--

232
00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:58,384
am I going
to the bathroom a lot.

233
00:10:58,517 --> 00:11:00,384
Are you urinating
a lot?

234
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:03,084
What does that have to do
with my ear?

235
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,451
This is a standard medical
question. It's all--

236
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:08,284
I know, but I really
don't think it's relevant

237
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,150
how often I go
to the bathroom.

238
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:11,817
With all due respect,
I think I'm the one

239
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:14,184
who should tell you if it's
relevant or not. And it is.

240
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,250
Well, let's just say-- let's
just move on. How about that?

241
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,551
What, you're not gonna
tell me about urination?

242
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:22,551
I'd really rather
not talk about it.

243
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,983
I don't see how it's anybody's
business, frankly, you know.

244
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,217
It's kind of private
and I really don't think--

245
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:29,017
- How is it private?
- It's private.

246
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:31,750
How often I go to the bathroom
is kind of a private thing.

247
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,817
Yeah, but I'm not some-- we're
not on a bus. I'm a doctor.

248
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:36,983
We'll just have to make a
diagnosis without this information.

249
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:38,983
I'm normal.
let's just say that, okay?

250
00:11:39,084 --> 00:11:41,716
- What does "normal" mean?
- Everything's normal. It's normal.

251
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:43,616
Three times a day,
four times a day?

252
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:44,750
Do we have to get
into a specific number?

253
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:46,716
Do we have to get
a number attached to it?

254
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:49,783
- Yeah, it's science.
- However often people are supposed to go, I go,

255
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:51,917
unless I drink a lot
of water. And, you know,

256
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:55,084
sometimes I drink a lot
of water and I'll go a lot.

257
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:57,417
If you had an office next to the
bathroom and it was one of those days

258
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,650
I was drinking a lot of water, you'd
say, "boy, this guy goes a lot."

259
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:01,384
but so what?
so what?

260
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:03,217
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about,

261
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,217
you know,
urination frequency

262
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,217
if I happen to be
drinking a lot of water,

263
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,750
which I have been doing
lately, so maybe lately

264
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,551
I've been going more often
than I normally would.

265
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,284
- Great.
- But it's good for you

266
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,350
to drink water.
that's a good thing.

267
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:17,650
- That's all I wanted to hear.
- That's a good thing, drinking water.

268
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,917
Yes, sure sure.
okay, let's move on.

269
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:21,117
Please.

270
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,451
How's your stool?

271
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:27,451
- Please.
- Stool's fine. Let's move on.

272
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:29,451
- All right.
- You know, again,

273
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:31,484
I mean, if I do
drink a lot of water,

274
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,484
I eat a lot of salad too.
so that's good.

275
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,317
It's normal, okay?
is it more than once a day?

276
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:38,917
Many times it is, yeah.
more than twice a day?

277
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:40,950
Sometimes, you know.
who knows?

278
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:43,583
If you had an office next to
the bathroom and I was going

279
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,017
and you looked at your watch and
you saw how long I was in there,

280
00:12:46,117 --> 00:12:48,284
you might say,
"oh, boy, he goes a lot."

281
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:50,217
but so what? That's
good. That's a good thing.

282
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,750
- All right, I apologize for-- -
let's just-- can we get to the ear?

283
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,117
Sure sure. So here's-- it's pretty
simple, really. I'm gonna suggest--

284
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:58,350
I'm exhausted
from being here,

285
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:00,350
you know, having to talk
about my stool,

286
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:03,750
how often I'm urinating. I
mean, you know, my ear hurts.

287
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,050
Okay, here's what I'm gonna
suggest for your ear:

288
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,317
you just basically
stay off it.

289
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,783
Use your left ear
to talk on the phone

290
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,650
if you need to for some reason
favor an ear, favor the left one.

291
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,583
Don't use the phone
from my right ear?

292
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,417
Yeah. I mean,
you just want to limit

293
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:18,317
the amount of noise
that goes into it.

294
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:20,317
You want me
to talk lefty?

295
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:22,217
Yeah, just talk lefty.

296
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:24,084
I have a hard time
talking lefty on the phone.

297
00:13:24,184 --> 00:13:26,484
Everything comes out wrong. It's
like throwing lefty. I can't do it.

298
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,850
I'm not myself. I feel different,
strange, like I'm not me.

299
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,650
I'm not comfortable
talking lefty.

300
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,551
All I can do is give you
my expert opinion, okay?

301
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,250
So that's what I'm suggesting. I'm
suggesting you stay off the right ear.

302
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:41,883
Okay, fine.
I'll talk lefty.

303
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:43,783
And I also think
it wouldn't hurt you

304
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:45,783
to talk to your therapist
about your bathroom issues,

305
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,150
'cause there's clearly
something going on there.

306
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:49,317
Okay?

307
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:52,384
I think I'd like to see
somebody else.

308
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:54,050
All right.
that's your right. Fine.

309
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,950
Is there somebody in
the office I could see?

310
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,950
Now?

311
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,050
No no, you have to
make an appointment.

312
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:04,317
This isn't mcdonald's, okay?

313
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:06,317
Okay, fine.

314
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:07,950
- Okay, all right.
- Okay, thank you.

315
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:10,017
Thank you.

316
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,750
What the fuck are you
looking at, jewboy?

317
00:14:21,384 --> 00:14:23,117
Fucking faggot.

318
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:27,017
That's right,
keep walking.

319
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:38,417
- Hey.
- Come on, let's deal with it.

320
00:14:38,484 --> 00:14:41,417
- Can we talk to you?
- What? Wow. Hey hey.

321
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:44,050
- I like Cheryl. She's sweet, but...
- yeah.

322
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:47,417
She's nice,
but the toilet paper...

323
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:50,417
I've never seen no
toilet paper like that.

324
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:51,983
Have you been
to port authority before,

325
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:53,417
- The port authority in new york city?
- Yeah.

326
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,417
That's what
it feels like.

327
00:14:55,517 --> 00:14:57,616
- Real close.
- I said the same thing the other day.

328
00:14:57,683 --> 00:14:59,883
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you get that from me?

329
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,317
- Yeah.
- Y'all got some funny kind of toilet paper here.

330
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,616
- We can't deal with this toilet paper.
- Hey, tell me about it.

331
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:07,583
- You know what I mean? It's rough.
- It's rough.

332
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:10,150
Well, you know,
it's an environmental thing.

333
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:13,050
She's doing it for the
environment. What can I do?

334
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:15,850
Can you do us a favor? Can we
get some soft toilet paper to use?

335
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,250
- All right, okay.
- The babies' behinds are hurting.

336
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,250
All right.

337
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,950
Here's what
I'm gonna suggest:

338
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:25,883
- You want soft paper?
- Oh, yes. No doubt.

339
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:28,783
- I'll get you your soft toilet paper...
- okay, cool.

340
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:32,250
...Under one condition--

341
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,017
I want access
to the toilet.

342
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:37,384
- You want to use our bathroom?
- So what you're saying is,

343
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:39,084
you want to come in our
bathroom and use our bathroom?

344
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:40,650
You got it.

345
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:42,650
- I want some soft toilet paper.
- okay, fine.

346
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:45,184
- It's all about the tissue.
- Okay, you have a deal.

347
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:48,017
- Auntie Rae, all right.
- Deal.

348
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,551
- My man.
- Leon. Oh, hey, by the way,

349
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,384
if Cheryl finds out,

350
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:55,917
you're all going down
with me.

351
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:57,850
- We got your back.
- We got your back.

352
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,817
- Cool.
- What it is what it is.

353
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,817
Leon, come here.
I need to talk to you.

354
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,084
What's going down, Larry?

355
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:06,184
Listen to this,
all right?

356
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:07,850
I'm in a doctor's office
earlier,

357
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:10,650
there's a guy sitting there,
a skinhead, okay?

358
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,551
He looks at me
and he says,

359
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,117
"what the fuck are you
looking at, jewboy?"

360
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:16,384
- What?
- "Fucking faggot."

361
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,716
what?
okay, what'd you do?

362
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:22,184
- What'd I do?
- Yeah, what'd you do?

363
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,683
I slunk out.

364
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,050
You slunk out?

365
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,750
Slunk.
I slunk out.

366
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,583
So you didn't do shit
and you punked out.

367
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,284
That's what the fuck
happened, right?

368
00:16:31,384 --> 00:16:32,950
Yeah, I punked out.
I punked out.

369
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:34,850
- How'd that happen?
- Well, what was I gonna do?

370
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,117
The guy could have
killed me.

371
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:37,850
Next time a man calls you
a fucking faggot,

372
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,384
you get in that ass, Larry.
know what I mean?

373
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:42,750
You get in that ass, Larry.
that's what the fuck you do.

374
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,650
- What are you talking about?
- You let that man slide today.

375
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,650
You gotta immediately get in
somebody's ass when that happens to you.

376
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,284
You pull their
asshole open,

377
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:51,451
step into their asshole,
close the door behind you,

378
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,484
- pick up your spray-paint
can, right? - uh-huh.

379
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:55,484
"Larry was here."
you spray-paint

380
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,417
"Larry was here," "wash me,"
all that kind of shit,

381
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,317
fuck his whole asshole up,
eat some snickers bar,

382
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,217
throw some paper on the floor,
read a newspaper,

383
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:04,683
ball the paper up, the newspaper,
and throw the newspaper on the floor,

384
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:06,917
fuck his whole asshole up,
you know what I'm saying?

385
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,417
Then you open that asshole
one more time--

386
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:10,850
open it again, open that asshole again
- uhh!

387
00:17:11,017 --> 00:17:13,750
Step out of his ass and leave
that motherfucker wide open,

388
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,850
- So he knows you've been there.
- Open it up,

389
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:17,117
- Step in.
- Step in their asshole.

390
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:19,017
- Spray-paint "Larry was here."
- "Larry was here."

391
00:17:19,117 --> 00:17:22,084
- Leave garbage, snickers, eat snickers, leave garbage.
- Spit, fuck it.

392
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:23,284
- Get out.
- Mm!

393
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:25,484
- Open it up again.
- Step out their asshole.

394
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,451
- Step out.
- Don't even close that motherfucker.

395
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,184
Leave it open
so he knows you've been there.

396
00:17:29,284 --> 00:17:31,117
- You feel me?
- I got you.

397
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,117
That's how
you handle people.

398
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:35,317
Mm!
get in that ass, Larry.

399
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:36,750
- Don't worry.
- All right.

400
00:17:38,384 --> 00:17:40,284
I hope you don't
get me killed.

401
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:42,517
My man.

402
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:05,484
-Hello?
- Hey, is Richard there?

403
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,517
Uh, no, he's not.
is this Larry?

404
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:09,983
Yeah.

405
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,050
- This is Cha Cha.
- Ah.

406
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,050
- Cha Cha.

407
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,017
Hi, Larry. You just caught
me in the middle of a workout.

408
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:18,783
So I'm calling
about the movies.

409
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:20,417
Yeah, the movies, right.

410
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,850
You know, we were talking
about-- wouldn't it be great

411
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,517
if we could all go
to a really nice dinner

412
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,650
in one of those
fancy-schmancy joints?

413
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,683
Okay, I'll tell--
I'll tell Cheryl.

414
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,850
Great.

415
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,184
What are you wearing?

416
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,417
What am I wearing
right now?

417
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:41,783
Yeah, what are you
wearing?

418
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:45,650
You're making me
uncomfortable, Larry.

419
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:52,650
- I'm gonna hang up right now.

420
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:54,350
I'm gonna
hang up right now.

421
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:56,350
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

422
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:03,683
I am loving this place.
Jeff, how great is this place?

423
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:05,883
It's unbelievable.
I'm having a great time.

424
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:07,817
It's like my old
barbershop in brooklyn.

425
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,451
Yeah, reminds me
of the old days, you know.

426
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:12,217
I like the whole snip-snip
thing, the sound of it.

427
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,983
I think I can do it too.
it doesn't look that hard.

428
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:16,983
You know, it's like the
bongos-- who can't do that?

429
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:18,484
You know what I mean?

430
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,284
- Yeah.
- Anybody can play the bongos, come on.

431
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:23,716
Do you have to be that
skilled to bang on something?

432
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:26,650
- Come on, how hard is that?
- I never thought of that.

433
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,817
When was the last time
you saw Burt?

434
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,384
Oh, I just
had lunch with him

435
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:33,084
the other day,
him and Barbara.

436
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:34,983
You notice anything
different about them?

437
00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:37,451
No.

438
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,517
'Cause she just had
a miscarriage.

439
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,017
- Really?
- Yeah.

440
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,650
It's a shame.

441
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,184
Shame?

442
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:48,451
They do have nine kids.

443
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,217
- That's it?
- Yep.

444
00:19:55,284 --> 00:19:57,750
Wow, that was
pretty fast.

445
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,184
You haven't taken
anything off.

446
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:04,184
Hey!

447
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:14,616
I'm good.

448
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,817
Where the hell
have you been?

449
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:22,484
I've been calling you
all goddamn day.

450
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,950
- We were getting a haircut.
- This is a bag of shit.

451
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,817
Oscar's been shitting. I've
been cleaning up shit all day.

452
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:30,217
He ate those leftovers
that that asshole gave us.

453
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:33,184
- Really?
- "We shall see."

454
00:20:33,284 --> 00:20:36,384
- "We shall see." Daviday.
- That little piece of shit.

455
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:38,750
- Is that possible, that that nut did that?
- Yes yes.

456
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,484
- he put crap in there. He put something in there.
- jesus christ.

457
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,217
- is he throwing up too?
- what a psycho.

458
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,350
You gotta go down there
and tell this motherfucker

459
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:47,250
- You're gonna kick his ass.
- Oh, yeah.

460
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,850
No, wait a second.
he can't go down there.

461
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,150
- Why?
- Because I took the food home.

462
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,683
- I promised him that I would eat it.
- all right, you go down there.

463
00:20:55,783 --> 00:20:57,683
- You go.
- Yeah, better idea:

464
00:20:57,783 --> 00:20:59,650
you go, Larry.
you go tell him

465
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,583
that you've been shitting
all over yourself all day,

466
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:03,817
shitting in your pants, you
can't make it to the toilet,

467
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,650
you got shit
running down your leg.

468
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,950
Why can't I make it
to the toilet?

469
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,017
Because it's more dramatic
that way.

470
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:11,583
I don't wanna tell a guy I
got shit running down my leg.

471
00:21:11,683 --> 00:21:14,017
All right, tell him whatever the
fuck you want. Tell him you've been

472
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:16,117
- Sick sick sick as a dog, okay?
- All right.

473
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,817
I'm gonna go to the
restaurant right now,

474
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:19,583
- See what he says.
- Go!

475
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:22,484
- You know, these waiters are nuts.
- He's nuts.

476
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,950
You can't get on a waiter's
bad side. They'll do anything.

477
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,250
- I never said anything back.
- you gotta be so nice to 'em.

478
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:28,683
You gotta leave
a good tip.

479
00:21:28,783 --> 00:21:30,650
- Jeff, throw this out.
- you throw it out.

480
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,950
- You throw it out. I've been
cleaning-- - no, you got gloves.

481
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,750
- I've been cleaning this shit.
- you got gloves!

482
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,683
- Throw it out.
- Aw, fuck.

483
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,783
Hello, daviday.

484
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:52,950
Hello, Larry.
nice to see you again.

485
00:21:53,084 --> 00:21:56,250
Good to see you, daviday.

486
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,017
You know,
I ate the leftovers

487
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,384
and I just want you
to know

488
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:04,783
I got sick from them.

489
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:06,650
Now when you say that
you got sick, do you mean

490
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,417
that the animal got sick
or that you got sick?

491
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:10,184
- No no, I got sick.
- You got sick?

492
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:12,184
Yes, and I'm just
kind of wondering

493
00:22:12,284 --> 00:22:14,250
if the food

494
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,084
perhaps was
tampered with.

495
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:20,817
Well, it most certainly
was not tampered with.

496
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,616
- Really?
- Absolutely.

497
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,616
Are you sure?

498
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:26,250
I'm very sure.

499
00:22:41,983 --> 00:22:44,917
- I don't believe you.
- Larry, how can you accuse me of that?

500
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:47,084
Because I was sick. I was
running to the bathroom all day.

501
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:48,417
- All day?
- All day.

502
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:50,551
- Oh, really? I see.
- Really. Yeah.

503
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,451
Aha.
Cha Cha?

504
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:56,184
Come here
for a moment, please.

505
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:01,716
Larry doesn't feel well. He said
that his bowels are irregular.

506
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:04,817
How many times has Larry
gone to the bathroom today?

507
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,217
Twice so far,

508
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:08,817
two minutes
each time.

509
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:10,917
Thank you.

510
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:15,850
Larry, that does not sound
like a man who's sick at all.

511
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:34,350
What's up, l.D.?

512
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:37,350
Um...

513
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:40,117
I'm just gonna
use the bathroom.

514
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:41,850
- What?
- Hmm?

515
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,350
Bathroom. I'm gonna use the bathroom.

516
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,384
What are you doing
in there?

517
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:21,850
The toilet wasn't
working properly.

518
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,484
- So you fixed it?
- I did, actually, yeah.

519
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:27,650
- Oh, okay, great.
- I had to just jiggle it around.

520
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,484
Oh, okay.
so it's l--

521
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,583
Hey, stay here for a second.
no no, I just want to see

522
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,750
your handiwork.
hold on.

523
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,484
Hey, don't go anywhere.
don't go anywhere.

524
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:38,384
Oh, wait a second.

525
00:24:38,484 --> 00:24:41,284
Larry?

526
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:43,750
Do you know how many
millions of virgin trees

527
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,917
are cut down to make
this toilet paper,

528
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,683
which is contributing
to global warming,

529
00:24:47,783 --> 00:24:49,850
which is causing hurricanes,
which is why you're here?

530
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,484
Do you have any idea what
I'm talking about, Larry?

531
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,417
- Yeah, that's what I was telling them.
- This isn't the kind

532
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:56,217
- Of toilet paper we use in this house.
- No, it's not.

533
00:24:56,317 --> 00:24:58,583
We use recycled
post-consumer toilet paper.

534
00:24:58,683 --> 00:25:02,551
- That's what I've been trying-- - so why do we
have tons of toilet paper in this bathroom?

535
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,317
And why were you in this
bathroom using this toilet paper?

536
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:08,917
Again, the toilet
was broken,

537
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:11,017
but they asked me--
they were very unhappy--

538
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:13,950
- We asked you?
hold there, hold up.

539
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:16,650
You liars, you were complaining
about the toilet paper.

540
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,050
- He wanted access to our bathroom.
- Auntie Rae,

541
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,117
don't blame this on me,
auntie Rae.

542
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:30,117
Hey, david,
come down here, pervo.

543
00:25:30,284 --> 00:25:32,417
Come down here,
you fucking pervo.

544
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:35,117
What? What are you talking
about? How did you get in?

545
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:36,850
The fucking door. How
else do you think I got in?

546
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,850
This kid has got to stop
leaving the door open, man.

547
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,050
This is it. If I didn't
know you my whole life,

548
00:25:41,117 --> 00:25:42,850
you know what? I'd attack you right now.

549
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,484
- What are you talking about?
- You called my girlfriend

550
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,484
and hit on her
and she doesn't respond

551
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,817
- And you fucking get her fired, you fucking piece of shit.
- what?

552
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,850
First of all,
I never hit on her.

553
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,883
- And what are you talking about, "fired"?
- Burt's dad at the barbershop.

554
00:25:54,983 --> 00:25:57,950
You made that fucking miscarriage
remark. So he fired her

555
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,050
because he wants nothing to do
with anybody that knows you.

556
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,950
Oh, he's supposed to be
getting back at me?

557
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,950
Who are you to tell him
how many kids to have?

558
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,616
She's got nine kids.
come on, that's plenty.

559
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,250
- She wants more children.
- How many does she need?

560
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:09,150
Who the fuck are you,
the messiah, to count?

561
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:11,050
I got news for you.
that's enough. By the way,

562
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,517
in china
you're allowed two.

563
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:14,484
- Those people would be killed in china.
- China what?

564
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:15,783
Two-- two babies in china.

565
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,150
What happens
if you have three?

566
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,317
- They execute you.
- They kill the baby?

567
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:21,683
Not the baby, idiot.
they kill the parents.

568
00:26:21,783 --> 00:26:23,317
Get out of here.

569
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:26,050
Well, maybe they don't execute, but
they give you a good dressing-down.

570
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,350
How dare you lose
my girlfriend's job?

571
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:29,783
She lost
her health insurance,

572
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,517
she has no self-worth
anymore.

573
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:34,117
- She lost her self-worth?
oh, really? - that's right.

574
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,983
You get on that goddamn telephone
and you get my girlfriend's job back.

575
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,983
You call Burt
and you apologize.

576
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,983
Okay, I'll make that call
under one condition:

577
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,883
I want to be able
to use your bathroom

578
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:45,250
- On the way to work in the morning.
- Sit on my toilet?

579
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:46,883
- Yeah.
- There's no fucking way.

580
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,883
- Why?
- Nobody sits on Richard lewis's toilet.

581
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,384
- You use every toilet in the house?
- That's right. I rotate.

582
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,883
- I can't use the basement?
- no, that's for weekends.

583
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,317
I have no place
to go to the bathroom.

584
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:56,650
I can't go here,
I can't go at work.

585
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,517
You just make the
goddamn call. You owe me.

586
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,551
- Jesus christ.
- I'll try.

587
00:27:00,683 --> 00:27:01,950
- That's all I can do.
- Yeah, fine.

588
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,084
Just get her
her job back.

589
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:11,317
What are you doing?
I want a righty call.

590
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:12,850
What's this
lefty bullshit?

591
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,583
I want a righty call.

592
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,517
Jesus christ.

593
00:27:19,683 --> 00:27:21,850
- Hello?
- Oh, hey, Barbara?

594
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,484
- Yes.
- Hey, it's Larry david.

595
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,783
Oh, hi, Larry.

596
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:28,750
Fuck you!

597
00:27:35,184 --> 00:27:37,783
The woman's out of her mind,
screaming in my ear like that.

598
00:27:37,883 --> 00:27:39,783
Can you imagine?
fuck.

599
00:27:39,883 --> 00:27:42,250
Thanks for taking me,
by the way.

600
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,250
You're damn right, man. It's a
big favor I'm doing your ass, man.

601
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,250
There's the building.
pull over.

602
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,417
All right.

603
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:53,883
Okay, park the car
and come up, okay?

604
00:27:53,983 --> 00:27:55,517
His name's
dr. Schaeffer.

605
00:27:55,616 --> 00:27:58,150
Dr. Schaeffer.
all right.

606
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,950
So you're all set,
actually.

607
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,050
We'll see you
next wednesday.

608
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:15,750
You get in that ass.

609
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,284
You get in his ass
immediately.

610
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:19,650
- Get in that ass, Larry.
- Hey!

611
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,650
Come on,
you fucking skinhead,

612
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,017
you piece of shit,
let's go!

613
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:26,084
He is not a skinhead. He
just came out of chemotherapy.

614
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:35,917
- Sorry.
- asshole.

615
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,683
- Hey, skinhead!
- Stop it. I'm not a skinhead!

616
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:44,683
- Leon! No, Leon!

617
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:46,217
Leon, no!

618
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:47,950
- MOTHERFUCKER!
STOP IT!
