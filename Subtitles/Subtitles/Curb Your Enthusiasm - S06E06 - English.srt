3
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:25,534
Unbelievable.

4
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:27,933
This is
the slowest toaster.

5
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:31,100
Man, oh, man.
I can't take it.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Cheap-ass toaster,
that's what happened.

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,733
- Hey, do you want to get this job today?
- You're damn right I do.

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,633
- Can I give you a little tip, huh?
- Let's do it.

9
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,700
You're gonna go in.
He'll be up here, okay?

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,567
You're down here, right?
He's on top.

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,534
- He's asking you the
questions. - uh-huh.

12
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:50,267
Then all of a sudden the interview
starts. He asks some questions,

13
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,900
you answer some questions. Then
you start asking him the questions,

14
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,434
and you flip it. Now he's
trying to impress you.

15
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:57,601
- Turn that shit around on him.
- Turn it around on him.

16
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,700
- Topsy-turvy that
motherfucker. - yeah yeah yeah.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,134
Why you got no credit cards?
You got no credit cards at all?

18
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:04,400
- Why don't you have a credit card, sir?
- You have no credit cards?

19
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:07,800
Why do you order these
cds out of those magazines

20
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,766
and be sending 'em
next door to the neighbor

21
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:11,334
and then when
the ups guy comes,

22
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:12,967
you pick 'em up like
you live there and shit?

23
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:16,400
You keep ordering cds
that you don't pay for?

24
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm just saying-- example
how to turn that shit around.

25
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:21,400
You know what I mean?
Specific shit, though.

26
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:23,833
I don't know. It might not be such a
good idea, this whole flip-it thing.

27
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:26,134
- I like it, man.
I like it.

28
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:29,067
- Hello.
- Hi, is this Mr. David I'm speaking with?

29
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:31,601
You know what? I'm sorry.
I'm really not interested.

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,766
- I understand you're in the market for a mortgage.
- Telemarketer.

31
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:37,234
- So to preserve your
financial-- - right, huh?

32
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:39,800
He's talking right now. Sir, I
said I'm really not interested.

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,334
He don't give a fuck. You
don't give a fuck about this--

34
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:45,700
He's still talking. All right,
please don't call here again.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,601
- Is there someone else--
- Sir, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,766
- What the fuck?
- They're crazy.

37
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,867
- Got the same phone.
- You do?

38
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:54,700
- Same damn phone.
- Yeah, this is a good product.

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,334
- L.d., you taking the kids to school?
- I'm taking the kids to school.

40
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:01,267
Thank you. Baby, get
your backpacks over there.

41
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:03,367
- There you go.
- Larry!

42
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:05,967
All right, one sec!
This is really unbelievable.

43
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:08,633
Larry!

44
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:11,501
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

45
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,766
I feel like
you forgot about me.

46
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,800
No no, of course not.
I didn't forget about you.

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,067
I don't have
anything to drink.

48
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,167
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:23,766
I'm dealing with that farkakte
toaster down there, you know?

50
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:27,534
Do you realize
how sick I am?

51
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:29,300
- Do you have a fever?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,733
- How do you do it?
This way? - no, I'm--

53
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,534
Please, if you would just
help me out a little.

54
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,633
Always had a problem
telling fever.

55
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:38,733
- Yeah yeah.
- Then you feel your head.

56
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,733
See, I feel I'm hotter than
you. Now I feel I have a fever.

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,700
Maybe I'm getting sick.

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,434
Touch my head.
Am I sick?

59
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:48,267
You don't have
a fever.

60
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:51,367
- Hey, guess what.
- Mmm.

61
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:54,633
Leon has
a job interview today.

62
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,633
- Yeah, that's good.
- Yeah.

63
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,267
And Loretta has one tomorrow.
This is unbelievable.

64
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,434
If one of 'em
gets a job...

65
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,367
- They're out.
- Look, I don't think I'm gonna be able to go

66
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:08,833
- to keysha's play tomorrow.
- You're kidding.

67
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,367
You-- you should probably take
somebody else or something.

68
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:13,900
Really? I wanna take you, honey.
I don't wanna take anybody else.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,900
No, I can't go out there
with other people...

70
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:19,200
- I wanna take you.
- ...and sit in a crowd.

71
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:21,733
Wanna take you.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,167
Please tell me you're
not coming on to me.

73
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:29,633
No good?

74
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:32,334
If you could just get me
some water and some juice,

75
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:34,067
that would be great.

76
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:36,267
- All right, anyway.
- I'm really tired.

77
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:41,300
All right, I'm gonna get
you some water, okay?

78
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:43,000
This is very nice,
by the way, this thing.

79
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,267
Okay, thank you, Larry.

80
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Hey!

81
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,000
- Ah! Hello, fellow parents.
- Hi, Larry.

82
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,700
- Huh?
- How's it going, Larry?

83
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,933
- Good, how are you, hal?
- Good.

84
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:59,000
- Hi, jean. Susie.
- Last. Yeah.

85
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,267
Hey, guys, I'm sorry.
I gotta get going.

86
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,900
I'll see you later, okay?
I love you.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,534
- Bye. Bye. Bye.
- Oh, that's so cute. He's so sweet.

88
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:08,534
- Bye. That's the sign for "bye," right?
- He's a sweet guy.

89
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:10,733
- Huh? See, I got that down.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,467
- Yeah, you're a genius.
- Huh? Bye. How about so-so?

91
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,300
So-so,
is that it?

92
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,833
- See, how about that?
- Yeah, that's great. Great.

93
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:20,200
How about,
"phew, it stinks"?

94
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,933
I know a lot more, too.

95
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,434
Let me ask you a question.
You happy with your toaster?

96
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:25,933
You happy
with your toaster?

97
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,000
Why, what's wrong?

98
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,867
- It takes forever. It's so slow.
- Oh, it's slow.

99
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:32,933
Oh, there's a sale.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,300
Sur la table. Sur la table's
having a sale on toasters.

101
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:39,000
- How do you know how to say "sur la table"?
- She spelled it, Larry.

102
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,733
- She spelled it.
- You're pretty good.

103
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,534
Yeah, there's a lot of things
about me you don't know.

104
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:45,467
- Hello, sweetheart.
- I'm going to that sale. You too?

105
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:47,733
- Yeah. Hi, sammie.
- Hi.

106
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,501
Ah! Spider! Spider!

107
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:51,766
- Oh my God!
- Spider!

108
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,367
- Come on!
- Larry, what is the matter with you?

109
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,400
- Killing a live creature!
- What?

110
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:59,134
What is wrong with you?
You're traumatizing these kids!

111
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,000
- What are you talking about? It's a spider.
- It's a living creature, Larry.

112
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,267
Oh, living creature! Do you want that
living creature crawling up your leg?

113
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,167
These kids don't need to
see that kind of violence.

114
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:08,733
It's a little spider.
Big deal.

115
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:12,100
- Are you okay, sweetie?
- Oh my god. Is that your dog?

116
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,666
I thought it was, like,
half rat or something.

117
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,733
Said it's a rat.

118
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,967
You know, like it looks--
No, it's-- it's a joke.

119
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:23,700
I was joking!

120
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,633
Joking!

121
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,234
- You insulted her now, okay? She can't
hear you screaming. - what did you--

122
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:31,601
You heard what I said. I
said you said it was half-rat.

123
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,300
How do you wind up
with a dog like that?

124
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,334
Mmm!

125
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:43,967
- Oh, hey, hal.
- Hey, how you doing, Larry?

126
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,666
Good, do you know what?
I- I'm glad I saw you again,

127
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:48,601
because after you left,

128
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,400
I made a little comment

129
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,967
that maybe didn't go over
so well with your wife.

130
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:55,434
I said her dog looked,

131
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:57,067
you know, half-rat.

132
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,933
- Really?
- Yeah.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,067
- I was joking in
my tone. - mm-hmm.

134
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,867
I had a joking tone,

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,234
but I guess because,
you know, she doesn't hear,

136
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,601
she's not able
to detect tone.

137
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,434
- No.
- You know, the dog.

138
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:13,400
It is kind of a ratty-looking
dog. You've gotta admit that.

139
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:15,900
- She loves that dog.
- How about you?

140
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,300
- Do you pet that dog?
- Yeah, I pet--

141
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:21,033
- You pet that dog? You pet that dog?
- I pet that dog.

142
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:23,400
I pet that dog, yes.

143
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:27,000
Anyway, just do me a favor
and tell her I was joking.

144
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,100
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I think you should apologize.

145
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:32,067
Well, I would,

146
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:35,234
except I can't
really call her.

147
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:36,700
The deaf thing again.

148
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,700
I know she's deaf.

149
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,867
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

150
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,367
Why don't you come over and
just apologize face to face,

151
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:45,800
so she can actually see it
coming out of your mouth?

152
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,633
You want me to come by,
make a special trip?

153
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:50,633
I wouldn't think
she would want that.

154
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,167
I would think that they wanna
be treated like everybody else.

155
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:56,067
- What do you mean "they"?
- Well, deaf people,

156
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:59,467
'cause they're the only ones who
need a special pop-in apology.

157
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:02,534
Every other kind of handicapped person
you can apologize to on the phone.

158
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:05,700
Deaf people require that
you go to their house.

159
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,267
Right.

160
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:09,100
I wouldn't think they
would want that. That's all.

161
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,267
I still would appreciate it if you
would come by and apologize to her.

162
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:13,800
She really
loves that dog.

163
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,633
That dog sits in your lap
while you're watching tv?

164
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:19,633
Yeah.

165
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,800
Okay, I'm more
than happy to come by.

166
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:24,633
Thanks.

167
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:32,167
What did you call me?

168
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,666
Fuck you!

169
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,933
What? What?

170
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:47,200
Cheryl was in bed.

171
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,467
She had
a little temperature,

172
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:53,267
but something about it that
kind of turned me on. She's sick.

173
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:56,100
- I understand.
- She's helpless. You know what I mean?

174
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,700
I like it the reverse,
when I'm sick.

175
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,501
Yeah, I like it
either way.

176
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:04,601
- I guess I just like sick sex.
- Yeah!

177
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:07,300
- It's all good. It's good, all right?
- Okay.

178
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,200
Okay, all right. So let
me ask you this question.

179
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,033
- You know my father's been kind of depressed lately.
- Yeah. Yeah.

180
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,567
So I'm thinking maybe actually
getting him one of those,

181
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:21,200
you know, the massages,
the happy-ending kind.

182
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,267
- Happy ending. I am the guy.
- Massage.

183
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,534
- Really, yeah?
- You want some names?

184
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:29,833
- Anybody.
- Well, I got some great ones, and they give great massages.

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,733
So he thinks he's getting a
massage. He's gonna freak out, man.

186
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,334
I know the perfect girl.
Her name's lisa.

187
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:37,334
- Lisa.
- Lisa, she will treat him like a king.

188
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,000
She's the best girl you
could possibly get for this.

189
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,467
- Best girl for what?
- What's the girl who cleans on tuesday?

190
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,567
- What's her name again?
- Oh, rosalina.

191
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,501
- Rosalina.
- She's terrific.

192
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:49,900
- You've got her number. You'll give it to him.
- Yeah, all right.

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,900
- Oh, you know what.
- What?

194
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,933
I need to ask you a
question about sign language.

195
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:58,467
I was in the men's room earlier
with hal...

196
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,833
- Okay.
- ...and I was drying my hands,

197
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,800
and I must have signed
something inadvertently,

198
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,300
because all of a sudden, he got
pissed off, said, "fuck you,"

199
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:09,434
- and stormed out. - well,
what did you do? Re-enact.

200
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:11,700
I was drying my hands,
you know,

201
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,234
and then I remember
scratching my finger

202
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:18,733
- like this.
- Oh, wait a minute.

203
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,300
Larry, this means
"cocksucker."

204
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,200
You called him a
cocksucker. Think about it.

205
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,501
You called him a cocksucker?

206
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,501
- You called him a cocksucker.
- Are you kidding?

207
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:30,300
He thought you said
cocksucker. Yes, that's what this is.

208
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,666
You called hal, one of the sweetest
guys in the world, a cocksucker.

209
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:36,200
He said, "fuck you," and
walked out? Good for him.

210
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,733
- Ha!
- Unbelievable.

211
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,666
Meanwhile, I got nobody to
take to see "grease" tomorrow.

212
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,666
- Oh, Cheryl's sick.
- She's sick, yeah.

213
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,933
- She's not even going.
- So you got nobody to go with.

214
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,501
Who watches "grease" by
themselves? You gotta go with somebody.

215
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:52,234
- I have nobody to take.
- I'll go.

216
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:56,601
I'll go to "grease"
with you.

217
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,033
That's mike.
He's my exterminator.

218
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:02,666
How you doing? I heard you
say you got an extra ticket.

219
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:04,833
I'd love to go.

220
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:08,300
Well, you know, it's a
middle-school production--

221
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,633
Kids doing "grease." you
don't wanna go see that.

222
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:13,501
I'd love it.
I'd love to go.

223
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:17,200
Well, you know,

224
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:20,567
my wife could
get better by tomorrow.

225
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,501
- I really--
- Okay.

226
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,933
- What?
- Yeah, no, I understand. I get it.

227
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,434
What? You get what?
What are you talking about?

228
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,467
I shouldn't have
done that. I'm sorry.

229
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,501
Mr. Greene, I'm sorry
about that. I'll finish up.

230
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:32,867
No, that's crazy.
No, don't be silly.

231
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,134
I just overheard that
you had an extra ticket,

232
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,300
and I love "grease,"
and I'd love to go,

233
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,800
but-- yeah.

234
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:42,200
All right, okay.

235
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,733
- That's great.
- Okay, yeah, you can go.

236
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,234
We're gonna have a blast.
That's gonna be fun.

237
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,000
That's gonna be great.
Should I pick you up?

238
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:51,666
Sure, pick me up.

239
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:55,067
Hey, we're gonna have fun.
We'll get fucked up.

240
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:58,134
- You know?
- Yeah.

241
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,700
It went good yesterday.

242
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,300
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Really?

243
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,567
- When are you gonna hear?
- I'll know today.

244
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:13,300
- Today? You're kidding.
- Yes, today. Oh, yeah.

245
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,601
- You flipped him.
- I flipped his ass good, man.

246
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,967
- Huh?
- Took the whole conversation over.

247
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,833
So you were
interviewing him

248
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:21,967
as to whether or not
he was good enough for you.

249
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:25,300
Yeah, I think I got it. I'm flipping ass
right now. I'm out of control right now.

250
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,933
- Don't flip me, man.
- How do you know if I haven't already flipped your ass?

251
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,367
- I'm unflippable.
- How do you know?

252
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:31,467
- Only women can flip me.
- I'll flip you, Larry.

253
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,100
Words to the wise, Larry:

254
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,733
this toaster ain't worth
a damn. Flipping toaster.

255
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,633
- All right, y'all, what do you think?
- Ooh, look at you.

256
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,467
- Do I look professional?
- It's on now pro-fes-sion-nal.

257
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,534
- L.d.?
- You're looking pretty good, I gotta say.

258
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,167
- You still gonna give me that ride, though, right?
- Yeah, I'm gonna take you.

259
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:50,534
- Hey, I'm sensing two jobs. Two jobs.
- All right.

260
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:53,100
- I'm feeling that.
- And then maybe, you know,

261
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:56,067
you'll think about getting
your own-- your own place.

262
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,601
So you really
like my suit?

263
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,633
- Man, that is banging, girl. Perfect!

264
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,200
'cause you don't
wanna be too assuming.

265
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,800
You know, even if one of
you actually got a job,

266
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,033
you could probably all just
move into an apartment, huh?

267
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,733
Yeah, something to...

268
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,467
- Hey!
- Hey!

269
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,067
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Hey. Hey hey hey hey!

270
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,900
What are you doing? I
thought you were coming later.

271
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,933
Later? I couldn't wait to see
you. I couldn't wait to get here.

272
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,800
My goodness, I am
so happy to see you.

273
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,467
Do I look good?

274
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:30,000
- Pretty good.
- Yes, pretty good.

275
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,200
Do I look healthier?
Do I look relaxed?

276
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,766
I gotta say, you gotta--
You gotta-- look relaxed.

277
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,567
You got a nice bounce
to your step.

278
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,900
Yes, I do have
a bounce to my step,

279
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,367
because something wonderful
happened to me, not just a massage.

280
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,167
- Really?
- I had a nice massage.

281
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:46,933
Oh, boy,
what a massage,

282
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:50,666
and this girl
likes me.

283
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,933
This girl maybe
even loves me,

284
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:56,200
and I am in love
with her.

285
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,367
Dad, I'm thrilled

286
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,633
- you had a good time.
- Yeah.

287
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:03,000
- You enjoyed the massage.
- Yes, I did.

288
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,167
They like all their clients.
This is their job,

289
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,833
to like their clients.

290
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,033
She outdid herself
on this job.

291
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:12,200
You know what I want to do? I
want to get her something lovely,

292
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,467
- something wonderful.
- No no no, what, are you, crazy?

293
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:18,300
- Yes yes, I'm crazy.
- Don't buy her any presents, okay?

294
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,933
- Why not?
- She got paid for the massage,

295
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,367
you don't need to buy her
any big present or anything.

296
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:26,033
Come on, Larry.
This is personal.

297
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,000
She did things
that say love.

298
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,933
Larry!

299
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,000
I gotta--
I'll be right down.

300
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,300
- Do you hear me?
- This is love.

301
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:40,033
Yeah, dad, you know,
they-- they like everybody.

302
00:13:40,134 --> 00:13:42,134
But this one
liked me particularly.

303
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Larry!

304
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,467
- Hey.
- Hey.

305
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,867
Could you get me
some wheat toast?

306
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:53,033
Wheat toast?
You know what?

307
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,000
Honest to god, I gotta take
Loretta to this job interview

308
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:59,000
and that toaster
takes a year.

309
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,933
This is what
I'm talking about.

310
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
- You don't care about me.
- No, of course I care about you.

311
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,134
I feel like eating for the first
time in I don't know how long.

312
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,933
All right. Okay, all right, I'll
get you the wheat toast. Okay.

313
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,200
Hey, Leon. Sorry, man.
I need the toaster.

314
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,200
L.d.,
are we leaving soon?

315
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,933
Huh? Yeah, I just gotta
make Cheryl some wheat toast.

316
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:26,234
I got a lot of time invested
in this toaster, Larry.

317
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:28,234
Now I'm gonna have to
start over again.

318
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,501
- You don't have to start all over.
- I gotta start all over again.

319
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:32,633
- You pick up where you left off.
- I can't pause toast.

320
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:34,933
- You can pause toast.
- If this toast goes back in that machine,

321
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,766
- it's gonna lose its essence, Larry.
- Leon! Leon!

322
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:40,400
Will you get
a man his toast?

323
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:51,601
Okay, here you go.

324
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,967
- All right, honey.
- Wait a second.

325
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,400
I wanted toast.

326
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:57,234
- That's toast.
- It's not toasted.

327
00:14:57,334 --> 00:15:00,601
- That's toast.
- I didn't want bread. I wanted toast.

328
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,567
This has been
in the toaster.

329
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,501
Can you toast it again?
'cause it's not--

330
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,334
You can't pause
toast.

331
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:10,867
Yo, l.d.!

332
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:13,400
- She's gonna be late for her interview.
- All right, go.

333
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:14,867
- Just go. - she's
probably all-- all--

334
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:17,766
I'm sorry, honey. I did
the best-- I'm sorry.

335
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:21,900
Larry!

336
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,134
- L.d., please!
- Oh my god, I am so sorry.

337
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:26,601
- Hurry! I need to go! - you
know, she's sick up there--

338
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,900
- I'm gonna be late. I have got to get going.
- Okay, all right.

339
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:30,434
Let me just get my--
Dad, come on.

340
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:32,167
- She's late.
- Okay, come on.

341
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:34,933
- I'm gonna use you as my
good-luck piece. - okay, come on.

342
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:37,501
- Oh, shit, my phone.
- What now?

343
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:40,501
All right, great, let's go!

344
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,134
I'm sorry, really.

345
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,234
L.d. Do you think
we can go a little faster?

346
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:49,400
Loretta, I swear, I'm going as
fast as I can. What can I do?

347
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:51,601
- Okay, we'll just have to step on it.
- I mean there's traffic here.

348
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,601
- I know it is.
- Look at this schmohawk over here.

349
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,167
Schmohawk.

350
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:58,900
- What?!
- I taught him that when he was a kid.

351
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,267
I used to call-- every
bad driver was a schmohawk.

352
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:05,167
Do you like that one?

353
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:10,967
Okay, thanks.
I'll be right back.

354
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:17,601
Hi. I know I'm late,
but I'm Loretta black.

355
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,300
- I have an interview with Mr. Badnick.
- He waited for half an hour.

356
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,700
He had to leave.
I'm sorry.

357
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,501
Can we reschedule?

358
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:27,434
He's already filled
the position.

359
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,067
15 whole minutes we were
waiting on that damn toaster.

360
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,700
- 15 minutes!
- It's a slow toaster.

361
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,033
Yes! Because of that damned
toaster, I missed my job interview.

362
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:41,800
I'm sor-- I'm gonna buy
a new toaster right now.

363
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,800
- Yeah, that's exactly what you need to do.
- Right now!

364
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,700
- I'm buying a new toaster!
- And I'm gonna get a toaster for lisa.

365
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,633
Will you stop it,
please?

366
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:52,534
I am gonna get
my love lady,

367
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:54,800
I am gonna get her
a toaster.

368
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,200
- I don't know, l.d.
- Look, you can put a bagel in there.

369
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,100
You don't have
to press down on it.

370
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,900
- Ah. So that's the bagel side...
- Yes,

371
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,100
- they've taken the bagel into consideration.
- ...and the toaster.

372
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:11,100
That's a good one, but do you
think it's gonna take all day?

373
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:14,267
Well, you know,
that's the question.

374
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,900
Uh-huh. What,
you like that?

375
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,367
- He's cute.
- Yeah?

376
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:21,000
- A little too beige for me, though.
- Too beige?

377
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,633
- Yeah, I like them chocolate.
- You like them chocolate.

378
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,000
- I like them chocolate.
- I could care less about shade.

379
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:27,434
- Really?
- Yeah.

380
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:29,900
- What do you like?
- I'd go anywhere

381
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:33,567
from like albino to the heart
of darkness africa black.

382
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:36,733
- No way.
- Yeah.

383
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,400
Oh, that's-- that's
jean. I'll be right back.

384
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,200
Hi. Ahem.

385
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,833
Toaster?

386
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,300
Yeah.
Yeah, you told me.

387
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,501
Sorry about what--
I was joking

388
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:57,100
about the dog.
Ha ha ha.

389
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,467
Joking, joking.

390
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:03,100
No, not a rat. No rat.

391
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,167
No no.
I like the dog.

392
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:12,400
You want me to kiss him?!
Yeah, to make up-- sure.

393
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:14,601
Okay okay.

394
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,300
Yeah yeah.

395
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,501
Thank you.

396
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:27,300
Oh, and your husband--
I was in the bathroom...

397
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,733
You know, and he was
washing and I went like this

398
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:33,100
'cause I had
a scratch and--

399
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,766
That's bad. "cocksucker," come on.

400
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,467
Misunderstanding.

401
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,666
Yeah, misunderstanding.

402
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,601
Okay. Sorry.

403
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,766
You'll be at the play?
"grease"?

404
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,234
- ...that she--
Kind of joy. - hmm.

405
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,501
It's not that.
Of course, it's some sexual--

406
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:59,967
But she's got a kind
of way of looking at me

407
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:03,134
- that makes me feel warm.
- She does it for you, huh?

408
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:07,033
- Oh my god.
- And listen, I saw a cappuccino machine.

409
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:09,400
I love this thing
and I know you are too.

410
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:11,601
You're not getting her
a cappuccino machine, okay?

411
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:15,867
Listen, dad. I set this massage
up, okay? This woman gives like--

412
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:18,700
You know, happy-ending massages.
She gives them to everybody.

413
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,167
I don't know what you're talking
about with this happy ending.

414
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,700
- I'm talking about this. - all I
know is, this girl, for goodness sake--

415
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
- You know. Yeah.
- Oh.

416
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,601
Oh...

417
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,200
No, that wasn't to you!
It's a misunderstanding!

418
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,501
Misunderstanding!

419
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:40,967
Oh, hey, hal. It's Larry david calling.

420
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:44,501
Um, there was a little incident at
the department store earlier today

421
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:48,367
with your wife. And she may have
misinterpreted something I did,

422
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:50,334
a gesture,
you know, uh...

423
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:54,067
Anyway, I just wanna talk to you
about it and tell you what's going on.

424
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:57,534
Um, call me-- actually,
call me on my cell phone.

425
00:19:57,601 --> 00:20:00,434
I'm gonna be out.
Um, okay.

426
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,601
Thanks, hal.

427
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,067
Whoo, keysha
is sick as a dog.

428
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:09,134
- What?!
- She's sick. She really feels bad.

429
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,800
- You're kidding.
- Nuh-uh, I think--

430
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:13,067
- She's not gonna be in the play?
- No.

431
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,700
- I think she might've caught that bug that Cheryl's got.
- Oh, man.

432
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,300
So I'ma take her some juice
and see if she can hold it down.

433
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,167
All right.

434
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:24,867
- Hello?
- Hi, it's bill

435
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:28,067
from woodcrest financial services
calling. I'm calling about the offer.

436
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:29,700
Uh, okay.

437
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,067
Bill, listen,
do me a favor--

438
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:35,633
Please stop calling, okay?
I'm not interested.

439
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:38,434
I've got an offer you are gonna love,
though. This is a serious offer.

440
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:41,434
You're a bit of a numbskull, aren't
you? Nothing seems to register.

441
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:44,267
When you order a soda at a
counter and you get the soda,

442
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,766
do you keep saying, "I'd
like a soda, I'd like a soda,

443
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,700
I'd like a soda,
I'd like a soda"?

444
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,967
Wait wait wait. You have any idea
what we're talking about here?

445
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,167
We're prepared
to make you an offer.

446
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:58,800
I just called Leon black
to offer him that job.

447
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,467
- He just about told me to fuck myself.
- Hmm.

448
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:08,434
- Yo yo!
- Hey, it's hal,

449
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:12,067
- just returning your call.
- What up, al?

450
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:15,067
What's going on, boy?
Yeah, what's going down?

451
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:17,334
Oh, nothing, uh,
you, uh--

452
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:20,134
- Are you calling to apologize?
- What?

453
00:21:20,234 --> 00:21:21,800
The fuck you talking
about, man? Look here, man.

454
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,800
Your lady came on to me. I hit
that ass and I moved on, dawg.

455
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,000
You wasn't in town, dawg.
This shit is over, man.

456
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,800
Oh, okay.
Oh, I get it now.

457
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,833
You're doing the black-guy character
because I'm a black guy, right?

458
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,833
Black man doin' his thing,
baby. Barack obama, motherfucker.

459
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,534
Barack obama, "I'm the
president, I'm hitting that ass."

460
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,467
Look, that's not cool, man, all right?
Actually, it's kind of offensive.

461
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,167
Don't do it, okay?

462
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,367
Black man's doin' his motherfucking
thing in the world, baby.

463
00:21:46,534 --> 00:21:48,967
- You feel me?
- Actually, I said, "don't talk to me like that,"

464
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,267
okay? It's offensive.
I thought you were calling back

465
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:53,367
to apologize about what
you said to my wife!

466
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:55,367
You have your wife back, man.
I don't want the bitch no more.

467
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:57,167
I just said I hit it
and I quit it, man.

468
00:21:57,267 --> 00:22:00,400
Can't believe you, man.
I cannot fucking believe you!

469
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:02,933
- I done moved on, dawg.
- Fuck you, Larry!

470
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,267
- Hey, Larry!
- Hey.

471
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:10,367
- Hey, you took my phone, man.
- What?!

472
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:12,067
- You got my phone.
- I have your phone?

473
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:14,367
Yeah, our phones got all
mixed up, man. You got my phone

474
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,534
- and I got your phone.
- How do you know?

475
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,467
I'm trying to call my boos,
man. Gonna use speed dial,

476
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm getting
all these old-ass people.

477
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,900
- Hey, sorry.
- Anybody phone me?

478
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:27,267
No, uh-uh.

479
00:22:27,434 --> 00:22:29,601
Anybody call me
from woodcrest financial?

480
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:34,766
- No.
- Hmm. Okay.

481
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,200
- Anybody call me?

482
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,000

483
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,200
- Nope.

484
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:47,633
- Give me my phone.
- Give me my phone.

485
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,367
Mmm!
Humph.

486
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:53,067

494
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,633
We met-- I run

495
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,200
and I was working
at Mr. Greene's house

496
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,833
and Larry was there.

497
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,567
That's-- that's
where I met him.

498
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:28,167
- You be killing them bugs,
huh? - yeah, bugs, rodents--

499
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:31,000
All those--
All that.

500
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,666
So, um, what you and
Larry getting into tonight?

501
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,367
We're gonna see
a production of "grease"

502
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:41,200
- and then maybe get a bite
to eat or something. - mm-hmm.

503
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:47,867
- L.d., my man.

504
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:53,234

- You look nice.
- Oh, thanks.

508
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:06,067
So you--
You found it okay?

509
00:24:06,234 --> 00:24:09,700
Yeah. Yeah yeah.
I've been here before.

510
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,700
One of your neighbors
had an infestation.

511
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,900
- Good.
- I already kind of know the area...

512
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,800
...a little. Yeah, it was easy, heh.

513
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,000
- Well, we should probably get going.
- Okay.

514
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:25,900
- Sounds good. Nice meeting you.
- All right, man.

515
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:30,867
Um, I-- I'll be
a little late.

516
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:32,967

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,700
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

531
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,434
- Pretty sharp, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

532
00:25:16,534 --> 00:25:18,267
Appreciate it.

533
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:20,367
Hey, jean.

00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,467
Yeah.

535
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,100
- You called and insulted her husband, hal?
- At? Are you kidding?

536
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,967
What? I didn't talk to hal.
No talk to hal.

537
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:34,800
- Yes, you did, Larry. You
called hal-- - What?

538
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,267
- You said racist remarks?
- What?

539
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:39,067
- You're lying. You're a fucking liar!
- Who's saying that?

540
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:41,100
- Are you saying that or she's saying that?
- I'm saying that.

541
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,601
- Oh, you're saying that! No talk, no talk.
- Don't play innocent.

542
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,000
Look her in the eye.
She knows.

543
00:25:47,134 --> 00:25:49,167
- You're a rotten apple.
- I'm not a rotten apple.

544
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:51,601
- Tell her I'm a good apple.
- I'm not telling her shit for you.

545
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,733
I'm a good--
Good apple.

She talks?

Good, you heard me!

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,000
You too!

551
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,467
What the hell
did you do, sicko?

552
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:12,733
What does he get her all upset like that for?

553
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:15,633
Ladies and gentlemen,
"grease" is about to begin.

554
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:18,167
Please turn off
all cell phones.

555
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:19,733
Thank you.

556
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:23,800
- It's a rat!
- What?!

557
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,800
I got it,
I got it, I got it.

558
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,467
I got it. I got it. I got
it. Look out, look out.

559
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:36,933
It's not a rat!
It's a dog!

560
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:39,434
It's a dog!
Oh my god, it's a dog!

561
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:41,900
It's a dog!

562
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,267
Oh, god...

563
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:49,467
It's a rat.
It's a rat.

564
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:56,733
- What did you do to him?
- It's a rat.

565
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,567
Well, yeah.

566
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:05,567
- This is it.
- Yeah. Uh, that was--

567
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,134
- That was pretty fun.
- Yeah.

568
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:10,467
Yeah, was-- feels,
feels good. It was fun.

569
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:12,933
It was a little weird
with that dog.

570
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:15,766
- You know, that's your training.
- Yeah, you know?

571
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,800
You-you reacted. That was--
It was-- it was instinctual.

572
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:21,666
- Yeah, I'd do it again, you know?
- Absolutely.

573
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:24,766
- Ahem. - yeah, it's
just-- it's unfortunate.

574
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,633
- It was a dog.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's the bad part.

575
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:32,100
Uh, it's sad that we
didn't get to see the show.

576
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,766
Yeah, I would've liked to have seen
it. I was looking forward to it.

577
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:38,367
Me too, a lot.
If they happen to redo it,

578
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:41,300
I'll go if you want.

579
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,234
- All right, we'll see.
- Okay.

580
00:27:43,367 --> 00:27:45,267
What are you
gonna do?

581
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:48,300
- I'm just gonna go in.
- Okay.

582
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,567
All right.
Yeah, okay.

583
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:52,766
- Bye.

588
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:14,234
- I made you some toast.
- Oh, really?

589
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
- You want--
- How's the new toaster?

590
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:19,100
It's great.

591
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,134

593
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:27,867
Oh.

594
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,766
- Do I have a fever?
- I think you do.

595
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:31,134
Really?
- Yeah.

596
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:33,134
I don't feel well, honey.

597
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:34,900
- I know, I'm sorry.
- Really?

598
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,766
- I'm gonna take very good care of you.
- You are?

599
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,833
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

600
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:40,967
Thank you, honey.

601
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,967
What are you doing?

No good?
