00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:17,050
auntie Rae, auntie Rae?

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,483
- You need something?
- I want you to come with me. I want to show you something.

5
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:21,950
Oh, all right then.
What is it?

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,150
Eh, don't worry.
Just come with me.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,550
You know, you said how
much you love gardening,

8
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:29,717
and how you wish you
could garden here,

9
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:33,050
so I cleared this
little area for you.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,550
- And... There you go.
- Larry.

11
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:36,184
You did this for me?

12
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:38,516
- I did it for you!
- Oh, Larry!

13
00:00:38,616 --> 00:00:40,516
- Huh?
- Oh-ho! Larry!

14
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:43,050
Grow some lettuce, auntie Rae.
Grow some lettuce!

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,984
You don't know how much
I appreciate this.

16
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:48,516
You've been so good
to us, Larry,

17
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:51,351
my family.
I really appreciate it.

18
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:53,351
I really
appreciate it, Larry!

19
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:55,883
Thank you, Larry.
I--

20
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:02,050
Larry,
you're disgusting.

21
00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:03,683
ah!

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,017
Agh!
Auntie Rae!

23
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:12,384
She called me disgusting.

24
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:14,483
Oh my god.

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,017
- What were you thinking?
- And she ran into the house.

26
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:21,017
- Oh my god.
- How does that happen to you?

27
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:24,017
You know, she went over the
appropriate amount of time

28
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,017
that I can have human contact
without getting aroused.

29
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:29,017
I only have five seconds.

30
00:01:29,117 --> 00:01:31,017
After that, it's out
of my control.

31
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:34,384
Not me. I've got discipline down
there. I have a very discerning penis.

32
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:35,783
- No...
- Very discerning.

33
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,017
- My penis is an animal.
- Really, just out of control?

34
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:40,284
- It's a feral tiger, yeah.
- It's wild.

35
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:43,017
Oh, so how'd your-- how'd the
appointment go? With the doctor?

36
00:01:43,117 --> 00:01:44,683
Great.

37
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,384
He's gonna snip-snip,
and...

38
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,583
I will no longer
be snoring.

39
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:51,750
- Really?
- Going in on thursday morning.

40
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,583
- Fantastic.
- Unbelievable!

41
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:56,284
- Fantastic.
- My dog howls

42
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:58,451
from my snoring.
I wake up my dog.

43
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,750
My dog starts howling.
I'm out of control.

44
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:02,583
- This'll be good.
- This'll be great.

45
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:04,117
- It's about time.
- It is about time.

46
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:05,850
- Yeah.
- It's about time.

47
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:09,483
Hey, guess what else? I think ben
stiller's gonna come with me as a client.

48
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,284
- Are you kidding?
- No!

49
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:14,317
- Have you met with him?
- No, I'm meeting with him this week.

50
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:17,917
- If you could sign him... - I
think it's a slam-dunk. Done deal.

51
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:19,683
It's gonna bring you in
so much income.

52
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:21,050
- Huge income, I know.
- My god.

53
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,750
- That's amazing.
- Hello.

54
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,417
- Hi.
- I know you couldn't decide

55
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:26,917
between the slaw and the soup,
so I brought you both.

56
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:29,184
Wow, thank you
so very much.

57
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:31,817
And here's your sandwich. Can
I get you something to drink?

58
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,750
You know what I'd love?
I'd love an arnold palmer.

59
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,850
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

60
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,950
Excuse me? Can I give you a drink order?

61
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:41,417
- Sure.
- I'll just have an iced tea.

62
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:44,583
- An iced tea. Okay. Arnold palmer... Of course.
- Thanks again.

63
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:47,616
Thank you.
Man, she's nice.

64
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:50,417
Yeah. Nice to people
with hair, she's nice.

65
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:53,417
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

66
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:56,516
- Yeah.
- Bald people get discriminated against constantly.

67
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,417
And you just saw
a perfect example of it.

68
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:00,150
Oh, it's because
you're bald.

69
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:02,483
Yeah, ask any bald person.
Ask, go ahead.

70
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,317
You still have issues
with being bald.

71
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,650
You know, if I were bald-- if I woke
up tomorrow and I found myself bald,

72
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,483
I'd be so cool with it. It'd be
no big deal. It's all natural.

73
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,850
- Yeah, right, that's what everybody says.
- Whatever.

74
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,050
Hey, they have
a pharmacy here, right?

75
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,217
- Yeah.
- I gotta get a prescription filled.

76
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:19,050
I'm gonna go now,
drop it off,

77
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,050
then I'll pick it up
when I'm done.

78
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,950
Beautiful.

79
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,883
- Hi.
- Oh, hi there.

80
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,117
Ah, let's take
a look here.

81
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:41,516
Can I get that in
the next half hour?

82
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,050
Sure. Yeah,
we can do that.

83
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,750
Great, thank you.

84
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:49,084
- That's odd.
- What?

85
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,351
I could have sworn
when I left,

86
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:54,150
I had about twice
as many french fries

87
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,717
- as there are now.
- Hm.

88
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,750
- You wouldn't know anything about this, would you?
- No idea.

89
00:03:59,883 --> 00:04:01,084
- Huh?
- No idea.

90
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:03,084
- No idea?
- No.

91
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:11,184
- No idea?
- I told you I had no idea! What's the big deal?

92
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,417
- Just eat.
- Maybe somebody could shed some light on this for us.

93
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:17,184
Excuse me. Hi,
I'm sorry to bother you.

94
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:20,950
- It's all right.
- I'm wondering if you noticed anything unusual

95
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:23,284
going on at this table
after I left?

96
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:26,616
Well, I-- I really
couldn't say. I don't want

97
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,451
to impinge
on a friendship.

98
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,017
Impinge away.
Go ahead and impinge.

99
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:33,384
I took one.
Shoot me.

100
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:36,017
One. Two of them might
have been stuck together.

101
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:37,917
Mm-mm-mm.
Thank you.

102
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:40,483
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes, Dr. Flomm.

103
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,917
- I'm an orthopedist.
- Really? An orthopedist?

104
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,384
- Mm-hm.
- Hi, my name's Larry.

105
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,817
Hi, Larry.
I'm-- I'm sheila.

106
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:49,917
Nice to meet you.
So you work in the building?

107
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,184
God damn, Larry.
What the fuck, man?

108
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:56,483
You hug my auntie, man,
you stab her in the stomach?

109
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,284
- Oh well...
- What the fuck was that?

110
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:00,850
She hugged me and she held
that hug for over five seconds.

111
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,217
- What the fuck?
- I have no control after five seconds.

112
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:05,217
- So you got a five-second
rule? - not a rule,

113
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:08,583
it's an approximate amount of time that
it's gonna take for something to happen.

114
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,750
What the fuck, I mean,
what the fuck? Loretta.

115
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,117
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- L.d.?

116
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:14,117
- What?
- You have lost your damn mind.

117
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:15,650
- No, I...
- Auntie Rae?

118
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,284
I can't control it. I have
no control. It's not my fault.

119
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,917
Just like that,
you got turned on?

120
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:22,117
Not just like that. That's
a long time, five seconds.

121
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,117
He got a five-second rule. One, two,
three, four, five-- boing, it come out.

122
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,317
- Where's your "mississippi"? You gotta put mississippi in.
- Both: mississippi?

123
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,917
That's how you count--
"one-mississippi, two-mississippi,

124
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:33,550
three-mississippi,
four-mississippi, five-mississippi."

125
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,217
- That's way too long.
- Way too long.

126
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:37,317
- You're stretching it out for--
- I'm not stretching it out.

127
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,317
- I shortened it.
- I'm just sayin', it's been a long time

128
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:41,384
- since my uncle passed away, man.
- That's right.

129
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:43,550
You all over her. You stab her
in the fuckin' stomach, man.

130
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,317
Believe me, it's not
gonna happen again.

131
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:47,650
You better make sure it don't
happen again, because we can go.

132
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,384
- We can go, man.
- We can go. We can go anywhere.

133
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,084
- Where you gonna go?
- Anywhere. Get out of here, I know that.

134
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:54,084
- We got places to go.
- You know, it's just

135
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:56,084
I'm so starved for affection,
I guess that

136
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:58,850
- any kind of contact...
- Talk to your man.

137
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:02,250
- You got one more chance, l.d.
- I just met a doctor, actually.

138
00:06:02,384 --> 00:06:04,417
I'm gonna go call her
for a date right now.

139
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:06,750
- She's very attractive.
- Handle your business.

140
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,317
- But no-- no more hugging, don't
worry. - oh please, please don't.

141
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,417
Call that goddamn doctor,
get a diagnosis,

142
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,750
and-and-and-- and go
stab somebody else, man.

143
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,017
And what happens when
you-- when you turn your palm?

144
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:19,117
- Yeah, it hurts.
- Worse, okay.

145
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:21,184
Just a moment, please.

146
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:23,850
- Hello, Dr. Flomm.
- Oh, Dr. Flomm.

147
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,017
- This is Larry david calling.
- Oh hi, Larry. How are you?

148
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:30,084
- Good, I met you earlier in the cafeteria.
- Yes yes, I remember.

149
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:33,750
- Would you like to make an appointment?
- Uh, no, actually.

150
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,150
I'm calling for,
um, a date.

151
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,217
Oh I see. Well, I'm
with a patient right now.

152
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:39,850
Oh jeez,
I'm so sorry.

153
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,583
Okay, is-- is tonight
good for you?

154
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:45,250
Actually I'm all booked up
tonight, but I am available tomorrow

155
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:47,150
between 5:00 and 6:00
or anytime after 8:30.

156
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:49,284
- Okay, I'll take the 8:30.
- Terrific.

157
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:51,417
Speak to my receptionist
to get the pertinent details.

158
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:53,783
- I'll call your receptionist.
- If you need to cancel

159
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,683
or in case of any emergency,
just page me.

160
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,150
Okay.
Okay, will do.

161
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,317
Good, and I recommend
being five minutes early.

162
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,683
Okay, I'll see you
tomorrow.

163
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:02,184
All right, Larry,
thank you.

164
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:04,583
Okay.

165
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,050
hi.

166
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,117
Is... Sheila here?

167
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:16,250
Yeah, come on in.
I'm her sister.

168
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:17,950
- Oh, hi.
- You must be Larry.

169
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,950
- Yeah.
- Just come on in, have a seat.

170
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,984
- Make yourself at home.
- Oh, thanks.

171
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:25,117
She'll be right down.

172
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:48,417
You have nothing to worry
about. It'll be fine.

173
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,250
- Thanks, sheila.
- Oh hi, Larry.

174
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:52,217
- Hi hi.
- This is my brother joe.

175
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,883
- Larry david.
- Hi, joe.

176
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:56,250
- Nice to meet you.
- I suppose you met trish, my sister.

177
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,483
Yes, yeah.

178
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,217
- Wow.
- Huh?

179
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:01,950
- You look great.
- It took me about two hours to get ready.

180
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,616
Your brother and sister,
they're staying with you?

181
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,616
Yeah, they're gonna be
with me just a couple months.

182
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,050
- So...
- You know, I've got people in my house too.

183
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,583
- You're kidding.
- No.

184
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:15,084
You know, it's great and then
sometimes it's not so great.

185
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,984
Well, I took in
a homeless family...

186
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:19,451
- You what? - ...from--
From-- from the hurricane.

187
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,616
- You're kidding.
- No.

188
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,683
Anyway, their--
Their name is "black."

189
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,984
- Uh-huh. - and-- and
they're actually black.

190
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:27,717
- Well, that makes it easy.
- Exactly, yeah.

191
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:28,984
Yeah.

192
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:30,883
- Can I move on?
- Absolutely.

193
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:33,150
Huh? All right,
I got a groin issue.

194
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,950
- Oh, okay.
- I-- I pulled it.

195
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,950
Did you ice it right away?

196
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,883
- No.
- Okay, so put a little bit of heat

197
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,583
- on the groin...
- Heat on the groin.

198
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:43,050
- ...and then I'd massage it.
- You want me to massage it?

199
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,516
- Oh absolutely.
- Really?

200
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:46,317
You never want
to massage with muscle,

201
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,817
- you always want to massage laterally.
- Lateral, okay.

202
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:52,184
For instance, this is your groin.
Just-- you just massage across.

203
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:54,984
Watch out for my testicles
right over there.

204
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,717
Larry?

205
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:07,417
Why don't we move this
to my bedroom?

206
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,084
Sure.

207
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,583
Go upstairs,
take off your clothes,

208
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:15,150
and I'll be in to see
you in a few minutes.

209
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:19,417
Okay.

210
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:45,451
Larry?

211
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,984
- Hey.
- Hi.

212
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:48,984
Uh, listen, I--
I am so sorry.

213
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:50,717
I-- I hate
to tell you this,

214
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:52,783
but my brother and
sister just came back.

215
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,750
- They weren't supposed to be here.
- Oh.

216
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:57,616
And my brother got food
poisoning, so they came back early,

217
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,084
and I--
I'm really sorry.

218
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,284
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- So...

219
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,417
- It happens.
- ...we need to reschedule.

220
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,483
Why don't you get dressed and
I'll meet you in the foyer?

221
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,384
I'm telling you, jeffrey,

222
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:20,583
there's nothing
like dating a doctor.

223
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:24,017
We talked for 45 minutes
about my groin injury.

224
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:27,217
No no, she just
wants me to massage it.

225
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:29,417
It's killing me too.

226
00:10:29,516 --> 00:10:31,750
Um, so listen--

227
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,883
I'm gonna see you later. I'm gonna
stop by before your operation.

228
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:36,750
Okay, man.

229
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,883
Okay, take care.

230
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:55,950
oh!
Auntie Rae!

231
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,850
- You know what?
- What?

232
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,417
- Last night, I know we talked about this.
- Yeah?

233
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:04,583
- This thing, you know.
- Oh, that thing.

234
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:07,583
- And believe me, I respect
your medical judgment. - mm-hm?

235
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:10,683
- I think it's cancer.
- It's not cancer.

236
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,984
Huh? I've never had cancer
before but I'm imagining

237
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,950
- this is how it feels like.
- How would you know?

238
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,683
No no, it's not.

239
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:18,783
I'm gonna...

240
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:20,650
Head to the men's room.

241
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,417
I-- okay, that's fine.

242
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,950
I just... I'm a little
shy about this,

243
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,783
and I just have-- I just
wrote you a little something.

244
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,117
- I think it might make you feel better.
- Moi?

245
00:11:30,217 --> 00:11:33,317
- Yeah.
- Ah. A note.

246
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,250
- Oh my god.
- You're embarrassing me.

247
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:37,351
Just-- just go
to the bathroom.

248
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,050
- Oh, excuse me?
- Yeah?

249
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,616
- Can you do me a favor?
- Sure.

250
00:11:53,683 --> 00:11:56,250
A doctor wrote me this note.
I can't make out a word of it.

251
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:58,883
You know the way they write.
They have terrible penmanship.

252
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,516
- Look at this.
- "Libby..."

253
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,150
No no, Larry.
That's me.

254
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,850
Something...

255
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,950
- Something "socks."
- "Socks"?

256
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,984
That's an "s"?
I thought that was a "t".

257
00:12:10,084 --> 00:12:12,150
- Tox?
- Truck?

258
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,717
Truck.
Do you have a truck?

259
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:17,516
- No, I don't have a truck.
- It's gotta be truck-- oh.

260
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,583
- All right, whatever, okay.
- I'm sorry.

261
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:21,084
- All right, thank you.
- Yeah.

262
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,384
Thank you.
This...

263
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:29,483
- Yeah, I'm at
the hospital.

264
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,351
Yeah, I fucked
my wrist or something.

265
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:33,150
Yeah, I was moving
a futon.

266
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,050
And I had to take the top
because of this 300-lb nigger.

267
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,950
Yeah, exactly. I'm at the
fuckin' top, and halfway through,

268
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,050
this nigger
drops his side.

269
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:47,351
So now
my wrist is fucked.

270
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,084
Oh my god.

271
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,683
You can't believe what I just
overheard in the bathroom.

272
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:57,984
What an unbelievable jerk.

273
00:12:58,084 --> 00:13:01,950
This guy is on his cell phone,
he's talking to his friend.

274
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,351
And he's upset
and he's complaining,

275
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,451
you know, he had to move some
furniture. And he says to his friend,

276
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,250
"I hurt my hand because
I had to take the top

277
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:12,883
because of this
300-lb nigger who was-- "

278
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:15,284
what did you say?
What did you just say?

279
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:17,650
- Oh...
- What did you just fix your mouth to say?

280
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:19,650
- No no-- - you just
used the most vile word

281
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:21,516
in the english language.
How dare you?

282
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:23,351
- No, I was--
- How dare-- in front of me?

283
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:26,184
You are despicable. I
can't stand people like you.

284
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:28,250
- I didn't--
- You bald son of a bitch.

285
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:30,550
I have to face this kind
of wretched foolishness.

286
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:33,616
This is ridiculous. I just want
to-- god! I can't stand people like--

287
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:36,250
Bald?

288
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:44,616
I wonder what's
keeping Dr. Page?

289
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:46,883
Why hasn't this patient
been prepped?

290
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,351
He is prepped, sir.

291
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:51,017
Excuse me, nurse.

292
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:53,384
- Clippers! - sir,
clippers are not req--

293
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:55,550
Do I have to do
everything myself?

294
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,883
I know what I'm doing here.
Clippers, please.

295
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,717
Thank you.

296
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,084
Oh my god! No no!

297
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:09,917
- What?
- Oh my god!

298
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,783
Look at me!

299
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:14,050
What the hell
happened to you?

300
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,150
- What happened?
- What happened, nurse?

301
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,351
Dr. Page accidentally shaved
mr. Greene's head--

302
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:20,817
- Shaved my head?
- Wait a minute.

303
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,750
- Accidentally?
- Did he operate on my head?

304
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,284
No, the procedure
was canceled.

305
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:26,750
The operation is going
to be rescheduled.

306
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,017
- So he didn't have the surgery?
- No.

307
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:31,017
Oh, you look horrible.
Jeff!

308
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:33,550
- Nurse, would you please excuse us?
- Doctor, what happened?

309
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,017
- What the hell happened? Look at him!
- What happened?

310
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:37,717
Mr. And Mrs. Greene,
I am so sorry.

311
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:40,017
I was coming to see you
in the operating room

312
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:43,650
and I had just been victimized by a
terrible incident in the cafeteria.

313
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,384
And so I came
to the operating room

314
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,917
and I was so angered and I
was upset and I was confused,

315
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,550
and I mistakenly
shaved your head,

316
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,717
- for which I'm so sorry.
- "Mistake" is correct.

317
00:14:51,817 --> 00:14:54,351
- You took it out on his head?
- It was a terrible mistake.

318
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:57,650
I can explain-- I'm leaving the
cafeteria, and I'm walking past a table,

319
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,317
and this horrible man
uses the most vile word

320
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:02,950
in the english language
to refer to a black person.

321
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:04,650
And I went
into a blind rage.

322
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,184
And I left there and I went
to the operating room,

323
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:10,284
and I made this terrible
mistake, for which I'm so sorry.

324
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:11,717
Do you know who
this man was?

325
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:13,384
I have no idea
who he was.

326
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:15,984
He was just
a despicable bald man.

327
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:17,817
- Bald?
- Ye

328
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,516
did he, by any chance,

329
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,017
wear glasses?

330
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:24,084
Yes.

331
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,550
As a matter of fact,
he was wearing glasses.

332
00:15:28,017 --> 00:15:31,317
And it was awful. It was
just absolutely awful.

333
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,650
"s..."

334
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,384
"sitter"?
"sitting"?

335
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:49,017
Look at him!

336
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:50,817
- Look at him!
- What the fuck?

337
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,750
- I'm bald!
- You like this look?

338
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:55,184
- He had a beautiful full head of hair...
- I'm bald!

339
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:57,483
...a mane that I loved
and now he looks like you!

340
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,284
- Look at me!
- What happened?

341
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:01,284
- How did that happen?
- You did it!

342
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:02,850
- I did it?
- You did it! Yes!

343
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,683
- What are you talking about?
- You traumatized the doctor!

344
00:16:05,783 --> 00:16:09,984
He described you. He said, "bald,
glasses." you said some racial slur

345
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:11,717
and you traumatized
the doctor.

346
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:13,783
- And he came in all flummoxed...
- What did you do?

347
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:15,984
...and shaved
his fucking head!

348
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:17,616
There's nothing wrong
with being bald!

349
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:19,616
- Sure there is!
- Yes, there is, Larry!

350
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:22,050
- Look at you!
- You said you wouldn't care if you were bald!

351
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,783
Yeah, in 40 years!
Not fucking today!

352
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,750
Because he knew it was
never gonna happen!

353
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,984
- Not overnight!
- Yours is gonna grow back. Mine isn't!

354
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,683
That's right. You know
what? Curse on you!

355
00:16:29,783 --> 00:16:32,050
Mine's gonna grow back.
Yours isn't! You deserve it!

356
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,883
What did you say to that doctor?

357
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,150
Here's what happened, okay?
Here's what happened.

358
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:39,451
I was in the cafeteria. I was
having lunch with Dr. Flomm.

359
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,717
Okay? What--
You know, it was pretty...

360
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:44,451
By the way, can you
interpret this-- this note?

361
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,451
Oh, nobody gives a shit
about your note!

362
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,950
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

363
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,351
Okay, so I went
to the men's room.

364
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:52,683
I'm in the stall.
There's this guy,

365
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:54,250
an unbelievable
asshole.

366
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,317
He's talking on his
cell phone to his friend.

367
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:58,984
He's very upset because they
had to move some furniture.

368
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,717
He says to his friend,
"I hurt my hand

369
00:17:00,783 --> 00:17:03,351
- because this 300-lb nigger
is-- " - what'd you say?

370
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,351
- What?
- What did you just say?

371
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,150
- Oh no no, I-- - did I just hear
the word nigger come out your mouth?

372
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,250
- No, but I was--
- Did you say nigger?

373
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:12,150
- Leon! Leon!
- What?

374
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,817
- Oh no no, don't--
- Leon, get your ass out here.

375
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,451
Larry
just said nigger.

376
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,917
- Get thfuck out of here!
- Larry just said nigger!

377
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,050
- How you gonna say nigger, man?
- No no!

378
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,616
Is that how you
feel about us?

379
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:24,883
That we a bunch
of niggers up in here?

380
00:17:24,984 --> 00:17:27,950
- I was quoting somebody.
- Let's get out of here! I wanna go!

381
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,550
What is all this fussing and
cussing going on up in here?

382
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,250
Larry d. Done
called us nigger.

383
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,616
- Nigger?
- Nigger!

384
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:36,217
- No, let me explain!
- You lost your damn mind now!

385
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:39,883
First, you're gonna be rubbing all up
against me, then whacking off in the damn car!

386
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:41,417
- Now you call us--
- I was massaging!

387
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,451
I'll come down there
to whip your poor ass!

388
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,284
- You done fucked up, Larry!
- I'll tell you one damn thing--

389
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:48,084
We ain't gonna
put up with that.

390
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:50,650
- L.d., I told you you had one last chance.
- One.

391
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,084
- This the last straw. We out this bitch.
- That's it.

392
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:54,384
- We out this bitch!
- Out.

393
00:17:54,516 --> 00:17:56,284
- Where you gonna go?
- We don't know.

394
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:58,550
- But we gonna get the hell out of here.
- You could stay with us.

395
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,550
- Thank you, baby.
- That's what I'm talking about.

396
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,817
- We appreciate that.
- Thank you!

397
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:04,550
Fuck you, Larry,
wit' your monkey ass!

398
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,351
Daryl! Keysha!

399
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:08,351
- We gettin' the hell outta here.
- You're damn straight.

400
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:10,084
- Get the hell outta here.
- Where the kids at?

401
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,516
Like how you do what you do.
It's a sexy ass, Susie.

402
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:14,516
Fuck you, Larry!

403
00:18:14,616 --> 00:18:16,550
Peace!

404
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,284
Well, look, I--
I think that

405
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:25,483
you're limiting yourself
by just doing comedies.

406
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:27,550
- Right.
- You can do it in your sleep.

407
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,017
Let's show people more.

408
00:18:29,184 --> 00:18:31,184
Why can't you win
an academy award?

409
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:33,817
The studios, they'll do
anything you want to do.

410
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:36,451
We just gotta push 'em
in the right direction, man.

411
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,284
- Yeah.
- That's it.

412
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,817
- I didn't just fall off the melon truck.
- Melon truck?

413
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:43,883
You sign with me, I will fight
that fight to get you those roles,

414
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:45,883
to develop those
projects with you.

415
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:48,750
That's what I do. You know,
you need to be doing things

416
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,117
that are more independent,
smaller in scale...

417
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:55,483
As well as the big-scale stuff.
That's gonna fall in your lap.

418
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,650
I'll do the work. You won't
notice anything different

419
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,650
except for the fact that
you're collecting awards.

420
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,483
Okay?

421
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,384
What?

422
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:10,384
Stiller said no.

423
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:12,717
- What?
- Doesn't want to work with me.

424
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:15,917
- Are you kidding?
- Doesn't feel it's right.

425
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:17,717
- He called you?
- Yeah.

426
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:19,451
Said "it doesn't
feel right."

427
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,683
- "Doesn't feel right"?
- Doesn't feel right.

428
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:24,050
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

429
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:26,817
You know what doesn't
feel right about it?

430
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,317
- You're bald.
- You think that's the reason why?

431
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:30,850
- Yeah.
- I'm not sure.

432
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,217
Doesn't want a bald man
to be representing him!

433
00:19:33,317 --> 00:19:35,550
Hey! You know what?
I know exactly what I want.

434
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,650
- I'm gonna get--
- I'm a little busy today.

435
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,750
I'll come back
in a little bit.

436
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:43,284
- Okay?
- That's weird.

437
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:44,917
- Weird?
- Yeah.

438
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,850
That's the way
it works, my friend.

439
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,284
Welcome to my world.

440
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:49,850
- This sucks.
- You know what?

441
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:52,750
- This fucking sucks.
- That cost you millions of dollars today.

442
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,284
- What happened.
- Millions of dollars.

443
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:57,017
- Millions of dollars.
- The hospital wants to meet with me.

444
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,683
They want to talk and--
And go over my bill.

445
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,550
"go over my bill." I'm gonna
sue these motherfuckers.

446
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,850
- That's it! That's fucking it!
- Right, good for you.

447
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,950
This blows.
How do you deal with it?

448
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:10,683
You just get used to it. And I
get support from my bald brothers.

449
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:12,917
- There's, like, meetings?
- There's no meetings,

450
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:15,117
but we see each other
on the street, we nod.

451
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:17,950
- We'll give a thumbs up.
- Yeah.

452
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,017
You know what? We love each
other, me and my bald brothers.

453
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:22,917
Still obsessed
with that note, huh?

454
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:25,750
I-- I've asked
10 people.

455
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,084
Excuse me, could you
do me a favor?

456
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:31,117
I can't read this. Could you
make out any of that handwriting?

457
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:32,417
- This from a doctor?
- Yeah.

458
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:34,516
Take it
to a pharmacist.

459
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:38,917
- What a great idea.
- Yeah.

460
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:41,217
They're the only ones who can
make out a doctor's handwriting.

461
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:42,850
Yeah, go!

462
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:47,184
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

463
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:49,950
Rry david. I dropped off a
prescription the other day.

464
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,583
- Ah yes yes, here we go.
- Yeah.

465
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,451
Actually, I want to talk to
you about something else too.

466
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,550
I'm going out
with a doctor,

467
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,550
and she wrote me
this note,

468
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,717
- and I cannot...
- And you can't read it.

469
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:02,750
I can't read it!
It's unbelievable.

470
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:04,750
- Nobody can!
- Yes.

471
00:21:04,883 --> 00:21:06,583
So somebody suggested
a pharmacist,

472
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,583
'cause nobody can
decipher this thing.

473
00:21:08,683 --> 00:21:10,417
Let me--
Let me take a shot.

474
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:12,417
You're my only hope.

475
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:16,050
"Larry, had a great time
last night.

476
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,850
Would love to get
together friday night

477
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,516
- at the bel-air
regency hotel..." - what?

478
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,683
"...just the two of us."

479
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,583
"so tired of all these

480
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:29,850
brothers and sisters
around.

481
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,050
I know you feel
the same way.

482
00:21:33,184 --> 00:21:35,717
Tell me your life
wouldn't be better

483
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,516
without the blacks."

484
00:21:38,616 --> 00:21:40,217
Huh?

485
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,050
Oh, okay, uh...
No no no no no.

486
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,317
It's your business.

487
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:48,583
- You're misinterpreting it.
- Here's your prescription.

488
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,850
- No, see I've got--
- Take your prescription.

489
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,250
- Thank you.
- I've got people in my house.

490
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:55,583
There's...

491
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:58,317
They're black but
their name is black!

492
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,783
She's got...

493
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:03,583
Her brothers
and sisters.

494
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,284
It's open. Come on in.

495
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:33,017
Hi. You have got
the worst handwriting...

496
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:34,783
Are you out of your mind?

497
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:37,050
- No? You couldn't read it?
- You expect anybody to--

498
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,084
- Couldn't read it? I
gave it to 10,000-- - oh!

499
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,616
- A pharmacist, a pharmacist wound up...
- I'm so sorry.

500
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:44,550
- ...translating that for me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

501
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:50,817
mm.

502
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,984
Thanks for driving me home.

503
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:15,451
Really, I--
I couldn't drive.

504
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,217
I just don't--
I don't feel like--

505
00:23:17,317 --> 00:23:19,817
I feel nauseous and like
I'm drugged or something.

506
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:22,284
And as far as
what happened earlier,

507
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:25,217
I'm mean, you know, usually
like, five-mississippi.

508
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:27,850
Honest to god,
five-mississippi--

509
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:30,650
That's all I need.

510
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,117
Why don't you just go?

511
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,284
Well...
Good night.

512
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,184
Somebody go in there and put a
sock in that motherfucker's mouth!

513
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,950
One second!

514
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:37,217
Hey, l.d.

515
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:39,217
- What's going on?
- Come on in, it's cold.

516
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:41,583
- You're back?
- Yeah. Couldn't sleep.

517
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:43,783
Jeff's snore? Man, I'm
telling you, that was awful.

518
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:45,883
Worse than
the damn hurricane.

519
00:25:46,017 --> 00:25:49,017
- I know, it's terrible.
- Kids need to sleep here. Y'all go on up to bed.

520
00:25:49,117 --> 00:25:50,516
- Good night, Larry.
- Good night.

521
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,417
- Good night, mom.
- Good night, y'all.

522
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:56,017
Talk to your boy, man. Shit, that
motherfucker swallowed a kazoo.

523
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:59,483
- Ridiculous. All fucking night!
- Yeah.

524
00:26:01,117 --> 00:26:03,084
Come on!

525
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,150
It's safe.
It's safe.

526
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,451
One-mississippi,
two-mississippi,

527
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:10,084
three-mississippi...

528
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,417
My own daughter
locks herself in her room,

529
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:14,883
won't come out
whenever I'm home.

530
00:26:14,984 --> 00:26:18,050
My wife-- one of the
most warm, loving people

531
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,150
you could ever meet--

532
00:26:19,317 --> 00:26:21,516
Has turned into a witch.

533
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:24,483
A witch! 'cause I'm bald.
It's changed everything.

534
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,117
Ben stiller
won't work with me

535
00:26:27,217 --> 00:26:30,417
because I'm bald!
I mean, come on.

536
00:26:30,516 --> 00:26:33,217
Do you know how many millions
I'm losing because of that?

537
00:26:33,317 --> 00:26:34,850
Millions I'm losing!

538
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,516
All right, I don't know
what else to say. Thank you.

539
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:40,084
All right, Mr. Greene. I
understand now we're going to hear

540
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:42,317
from Mr. Larry david,

541
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:45,817
who will testify on mr.
Greene's behalf. Mr. David?

542
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,150
- Thank you for being here.
- You're welcome.

543
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,516
Mr. David, as you know,
we are looking into

544
00:26:50,616 --> 00:26:52,850
allegations
of physician misconduct

545
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,084
stemming
from the incident

546
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,984
on the 17th
of this month.

547
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:59,516
Would you please tell
the board what happened?

548
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:02,317
I was having lunch
in the cafeteria,

549
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:05,516
and I excused myself
to go to the bathroom.

550
00:27:05,616 --> 00:27:09,384
You know, it's--
It's a thing we all do.

551
00:27:09,516 --> 00:27:11,250
It's not a crime, right?

552
00:27:11,351 --> 00:27:14,250
- Don't have to be embarrassed.
- No need for embarrassment.

553
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:15,550
Go ahead.

554
00:27:15,616 --> 00:27:17,250
Anyway, I went
into the stall.

555
00:27:17,351 --> 00:27:20,417
Generally, when I--
When I use a public toilet,

556
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:23,084
I'll-- I'll go into the stall
as opposed to the urinals.

557
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:25,616
I find there's, you know,
there's no privacy.

558
00:27:25,717 --> 00:27:28,616
And if there's no dividers, it's
kind of like going in a trough.

559
00:27:28,717 --> 00:27:30,516
All right, all right.
Go ahead, please.

560
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,683
Anyway, so I went
into the stall--

561
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:35,417
I guess it's kind
of a habit now

562
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:37,516
for me to go
into the stall, in a way.

563
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:39,783
Um, if it's open,
if it's available,

564
00:27:39,883 --> 00:27:41,616
I'll-- I'll generally
take the stall.

565
00:27:41,717 --> 00:27:44,917
Of course, what you find in there
is-- you know, is anybody's guess.

566
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:47,351
Anyway,
so I'm in the stall,

567
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:51,817
and I overhear this guy
talking on his cell phone.

568
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:55,150
And he's talking to a friend of
his, and he's getting very upset

569
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,150
'cause he had to move
some furniture

570
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,351
and he hurt his hand.
And he-- and he's saying,

571
00:27:59,451 --> 00:28:02,351
- "and then I hurt my hand
'cause this 300-lb-- "

572
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,717
sorry I'm late.

573
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:10,417
Please continue,
mr. David.

574
00:28:10,516 --> 00:28:12,950
Go ahead, sir.

575
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,616
Please continue.

576
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,017
Mr. David,
is there a problem?

577
00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:23,284
Please, tell us what the
man on the cell phone said.

578
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,117
Mr. David, tell us
what the man said!

579
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:31,850
- Just say it!
- You are wasting this committee's time.

580
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,483
- Larry, tell 'em.
- Please tell us what the man said.

581
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,451
- Say it!
- Tell 'em! Will you tell them?

582
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,217
- Just say it!
- Larry, just tell 'em!

583
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,184
- Tell us what the man said!
- Tell them, please?

584
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:42,284
- Just do it, Larry!
- Tell us now, Mr. David!

585
00:28:42,384 --> 00:28:45,017
- Just say it!
- Larry, tell 'em!
