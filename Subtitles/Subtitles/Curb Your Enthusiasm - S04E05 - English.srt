1
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:11,413
# Leo and Max,
up off our backs #

2
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,681
# Back on the great
white way #

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,248
# Leo and Max,
back on the tracks #

4
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,987
# We're back
on top to stay. #

5
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:24,359
Okay, that's enough.
Larry!

6
00:00:24,396 --> 00:00:27,263
You've been
doing your homework.

7
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:28,926
- I'm all astonishment.
- Really?!

8
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:31,026
It is fantastic, fierce,
absolutely fierce.

9
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:32,764
- Was it fierce?
- Yes, it was fierce.

10
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:34,795
- Really fierce?
- Really fierce.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,274
- My problem child no longer.
- How did, uh...

12
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:38,970
I mean,
was I there too, or?

13
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:40,808
Yeah yeah, you were
doing the steps.

14
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:43,406
Um, a little bit late
on the pas de bourrée

15
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:45,939
which then makes you late
for the hitch-kick.

16
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:49,317
Pas de bourée's are really tough.
Pas de bourrée's are the toughest thing.

17
00:00:49,354 --> 00:00:51,754
It'll get easier.
Yeah.

18
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,315
But, oh my God, the difference
is just astonishing.

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,294
- I don't even think about it anymore.
- Of course not.

20
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,388
- That's what I told you would happen.
- Yeah.

21
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:02,332
- 'Cause it's in the muscle memory now.
- Hey...

22
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:04,927
- Michael, too bad you can't see.
- Tell me about it.

23
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,063
- It was great.
- All right, thank you.

24
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:09,335
- Great. Okay.
- In a minute. Okay.

25
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:14,869
- Hey.
- Hey.

26
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:16,574
Don't let that
pas de bourrée stuff...

27
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:18,981
Oh no, I'm not worried about it.
I mean, I'll get it.

28
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:22,043
If you wanna do
any extra work on that...

29
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:24,954
- You wanna continue?
- Oh, I can't today. I'm meeting my dad.

30
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,787
But, uh, tomorrow
would be great.

31
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,521
- Oh, okay. Your dad, huh?
- Yeah.

32
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,153
- Oh, he lives here?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:32,527
- No kidding? Wow.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:34,657
What does he do?

35
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,965
Um, you know
Health-Glo?

36
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:40,403
- The mixed nuts?
- Yeah, I've seen that.

37
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,964
- Absolutely. That's his?
- They're packages of...

38
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:45,875
That's him. My dad is Health-Glo.
He started that when he was,

39
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:48,311
like, I don't know, right out
of college or something.

40
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:52,215
You know what? I get ideas
all the time about mixed nut packages.

41
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,684
Like, I'll see a mixed nut
package, I'll think,

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,121
what would I want to put in a mixed nut?
I have my own ideas about that.

43
00:01:58,156 --> 00:02:01,421
Maybe I could pitch some... some ideas
to your dad. How would that be?

44
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,293
If I said I want
to combine a pecan

45
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,127
and a blueberry,
you know?

46
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:09,497
- Yeah.
- And a dried cherry,

47
00:02:09,534 --> 00:02:12,230
and maybe a, uh,
a filbert or something?

48
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,637
You know, it's kind of like
everyone has their idea

49
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:18,108
of what would be
the best combo.

50
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:21,044
Just pitching... you know how it is.
Come on, you must get

51
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:25,175
people on the street come up
and pitch you story ideas and stuff.

52
00:02:25,217 --> 00:02:28,118
It's just... you know what,
stay in your element.

53
00:02:28,153 --> 00:02:30,713
Yeah. But I do have
some good ideas.

54
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:33,725
- I'm sure you do.
- Hey, 9:00 A.M. tomorrow, guys.

55
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,192
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

56
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:36,854
I'm gonna
go get a snack.

57
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:39,056
- Snack? I'll go with you.
- Yeah. Oh, great.

58
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:43,261
You and David are so good together.
I'm so happy.

59
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:45,462
- Love him, love that guy.
- Oh God.

60
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:47,267
Your chemistry together
is fierce.

61
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:49,535
- It is fierce.
- Absolutely fierce, totally.

62
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:51,633
- It's fierce.
- Ah, so much better than Ben,

63
00:02:51,677 --> 00:02:54,441
- don't you think?
- Ben was so bossy.

64
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,845
Yeah, you know he had that
kind of entitled attitude.

65
00:02:56,882 --> 00:03:00,545
- I don't care for it at all.
- Totally, I know.

66
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:03,577
Oh my God, my friend Anthony
was supposed to come to rehearsal.

67
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:05,681
That's right,
and he didn't show up.

68
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:07,885
Oh, I'm so worried about him.
He's a doctor,

69
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:09,917
he's gorgeous,
he's smart, obviously,

70
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:12,452
and he's single now... he just
had a horrible break up.

71
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:15,159
So I'm kind of looking for somebody
to match him up with now.

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,929
- Is he good looking?
- Gorgeous.

73
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:18,492
# Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba #

74
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:21,472
# Pirate's Booty,
Pirate's Booty... #

75
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:23,667
You're embarrassing me.
Stop it, no.

76
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,473
- I can't have Pirate's Booty?
- No, but you can have a pear.

77
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:28,274
- Hey!
- What?

78
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:30,213
Look at this,
Health-Glo.

79
00:03:30,248 --> 00:03:32,375
- Those are Schwimmer's dad's nuts.
- Yeah.

80
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:35,079
Yes, let's check
these out.

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,849
- Good stats.
- Look at this.

82
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:38,788
There's only
four cashews in here.

83
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:41,554
- The numbers are good.
- Look, they're all the same.

84
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:44,756
- This one's got four, three.
- That's probably a mistake.

85
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:47,788
The whole cashew-raisin
balance is askew.

86
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,631
- It's awful.
- There's gotta be more cashews.

87
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:53,900
- Absolutely.
- Schwimmer's dad's pulling a fast one.

88
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,499
- All right, well.
- You can eat two packages of them.

89
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,840
Fine, two packages. You know what?
I gotta get out of this place.

90
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:02,540
- I gotta get to my office.
- Okay.

91
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:10,248
# Back on the great
white way. #

92
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:12,222
Hey, Broadway.

93
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:14,282
- How was rehearsal?
- It was good.

94
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:15,850
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

95
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:18,124
- Schwimmer's great.
- Is he great?

96
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:19,653
- He's fierce.
- Is he?

97
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:21,996
- Yes.
- Look at you with the dancing terms.

98
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,627
I'm glad it's going well.

99
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:27,968
- Yeah, it's going great.
- I got you a something to say thank you

100
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:29,667
for those
"Tonight Show" tickets.

101
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:33,439
- You didn't have to do that.
- My mom had the best time.

102
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:35,844
- What do we got?
- Just a little thing.

103
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:37,815
Oh, a picture frame.
Thank you.

104
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:40,545
I didn't know what to get
and Cheryl said it might be nice.

105
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:44,077
- Put a glamour shot of her on the desk.
- Is that what she suggested?

106
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:46,317
And the dental hygienist
called.

107
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:49,122
- She said please call when you get in.
- Dental hygienist?

108
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:50,890
Hm, I wonder
what she wants.

109
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,261
- I just saw her last week.
- Mm-hmm.

110
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,061
Well.

111
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,035
Get together?
You and me?

112
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:00,401
- Really?
- Am I being too forward?

113
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:03,407
'Cause, when you
were at the office,

114
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:04,965
you gave me
the tongue sign.

115
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,308
Tongue sign?
Pfft!

116
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:10,974
I was just really trying to get
some cotton out of my mouth.

117
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,318
So, uh, I don't get it.
Why me?

118
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:17,879
I don't know. You remind me
of my college history teacher.

119
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:20,118
Was he an avuncular
bald Jew?

120
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:23,286
Larry, I was...
oh, I'm sorry.

121
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:26,024
Um, you left your script
at the rehearsal.

122
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:28,294
- I was in the area.
- Thank you so much.

123
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,824
- So I can leave this here?
- Put it down over there.

124
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:33,099
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

125
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:45,744
- Hello?
- So where were we?

126
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:49,718
She calls me just
out of the blue.

127
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:52,689
Out of the blue.
It's all set up.

128
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:56,285
It's all set up
for next Thursday.

129
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:57,852
Wow.

130
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:00,760
Can I do this?
Is it wrong?

131
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:04,496
You'll never get another opportunity like
this for the rest of your life.

132
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:07,767
You have to do this. It's a gift
from your wife. She wants you to do it.

133
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:09,501
It's my 10th
anniversary present.

134
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,669
It's your 10th anniversary present.
You have to do it.

135
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:15,236
Oh, I hope
I can do it.

136
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,714
- She's fierce.
- Okay.

137
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:19,944
At first I thought
it was my imagination,

138
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:21,646
but you're talking
really gay.

139
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:25,386
- No no no, really gay.
- Get out of here.

140
00:06:25,423 --> 00:06:27,755
Fierce? Where does fierce
come from?

141
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,692
And everything
is this and that.

142
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:32,993
- What do you think?
- Steve the choreographer says it.

143
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:36,262
Steve the choreographer... you been
spending a lot of time with him?

144
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:40,032
- I probably picked up some mannerisms. -
Some? All! You're him!

145
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:41,834
- What?
- You're him.

146
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:44,171
You've become Steve
the gay choreographer.

147
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:46,074
- It's not that bad.
- No, it's that bad.

148
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:48,671
At first I thought,
no no no, then..."fierce!"

149
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:53,317
- Okay.
- What's going on with your locker?

150
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:55,751
- What?
- It's a pigsty, man.

151
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:57,982
- So what?
- It's decorum. Have respect.

152
00:06:58,023 --> 00:07:00,355
What are you doing
throwing all that shit on the ground?

153
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:01,950
- Mind your own business.
- Hey, Norm.

154
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:03,984
- Hey, Jeff.
- Hey, Norm.

155
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:07,089
- Hello, Larry.
- Norm, you should've seen rehearsals.

156
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:09,362
They're really
coming along.

157
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:11,198
Oh, good.
Mel told me.

158
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:14,865
Hey, I forgot to ask you,
wanna play golf on Saturday

159
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:16,533
- with Marty Funkhouser?
- Sure.

160
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:19,668
I don't think you'll be playing golf
with Marty Funkhouser this Saturday.

161
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:22,544
- Why?
- You know Leo his father?

162
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,378
- Yeah.
- We lost him yesterday.

163
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:28,682
- Hodgkin's, real bad.
- Oh.

164
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,720
I thought he had
the good Hodgkin's.

165
00:07:32,757 --> 00:07:34,384
- No such thing as good Hodgkin's.
- Yes, there is.

166
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:36,553
How do you know?
What's your proof?

167
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:38,186
I'm gonna tell you
how I know, okay?

168
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:39,753
I used to watch
"Party of Five"...

169
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:41,698
"Party of Five,"
right there.

170
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:45,601
Charlie, the orphan son, the oldest one, he
had good Hodgkin's.

171
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:48,970
I wouldn't be going around quoting
good Hodgkin's based on "Party of Five."

172
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:51,441
- Just me.
- Okay, fine.

173
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:54,536
- Half off.
- Really?

174
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,638
- Here you go, guys.
- What a deal.

175
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:59,275
- I know.
- You guys got a nice day.

176
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:02,252
- Thank you, Sven.
- You're welcome.

177
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:05,154
All right. What is that?
Is that Swedish, Sven?

178
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,021
It's Norwegian.

179
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,128
I'm sorry, I thought
Sven was a Swedish name.

180
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:15,359
It's not. 'Cause I don't look
Swedish, do I?

181
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,493
It's a big difference.

182
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:19,867
Apparently.
What's the difference, may I ask?

183
00:08:19,904 --> 00:08:24,364
Culture, looks, names,
history, food, dancing.

184
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:26,741
Okay okay, sorry,
honest mistake.

185
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:30,807
Are Swedes touchy if you
refer to them as Norwegians?

186
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:33,750
- Why don't you ask a Swede?
- Yeah, maybe I will.

187
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,589
- Hey.
- Hi.

188
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:42,081
- Hey, fancy-pants.
- Oh yeah, I gotta go to a funeral.

189
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:45,585
- Uh, oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, it's a guy I knew.

190
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,292
- Are you okay to move and stuff?
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

191
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,564
- I was in this store a few days ago.
- Yeah?

192
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:55,095
And, uh, I saw a bag
of your dad's cashew-raisins.

193
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,937
Oh, good good,
did you get it?

194
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:59,205
Yeah.
He's kind of, uh...

195
00:08:59,244 --> 00:09:02,236
he's kind of skimping on
the cashews a little bit.

196
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,907
Uh, what do you mean?

197
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:07,281
There's like four cashews
in a whole bag, you know?

198
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:10,685
- Um...
- Here look. I'll show you.

199
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:13,020
See?

200
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:15,686
Wow, you... you saved
a bag to show me.

201
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:18,890
I didn't save it. I'm going
to the funeral, I need a snack actually.

202
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,194
They're very good.
They're delicious cashews,

203
00:09:21,232 --> 00:09:23,928
but would it kill him to put
three more cashews in there?

204
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:27,199
You know what it is? I mean,
the cashews are expensive, first of all.

205
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:31,368
Um, there's a... you know
there's a shortage right now.

206
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,707
- Cashew shortage?
- It's for the last several...

207
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:36,942
- actually, several years.
- I never read about a cashew shortage.

208
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:39,006
That's because
you're not in the industry.

209
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,450
- Can I give him a little advice?
- Please.

210
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:44,978
I would call it raisins.

211
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:48,151
And then let people be
surprised by the cashews.

212
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:50,218
You're not serious,
are you?

213
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:52,991
I am, yeah. It's better than
being disappointed

214
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:55,499
by buying something
called cashew-raisins.

215
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:58,331
We could put more in there,
but they'd charge you a lot more.

216
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:01,463
That's the balance. We wanted
to make an affordable snack.

217
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:04,407
- An affordable snack.
- Give me three more cashews in here,

218
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:07,309
I'll be a happy man.
Then I think you got the right ratio.

219
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:10,109
That's all.
No big deal.

220
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:13,447
Should we just rehearse?
Can we get started?

221
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:18,714
Hey.

222
00:10:18,756 --> 00:10:20,724
Hey.

223
00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:24,250
Look at this.
Letter from the club.

224
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:26,354
I didn't get one.

225
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:29,628
- Having a dirty locker.
- You're kidding me?!

226
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,999
If I don't clean it,
they're gonna suspend me.

227
00:10:32,036 --> 00:10:35,733
- You believe this bullshit?
- Wow, how do you think they found out?

228
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:38,799
- Norm.
- Why would he do something like that?

229
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:41,038
- He hates me.
- He hates you, huh?

230
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:44,571
- He hates me.
- Wow, that's a horrible thing to do.

231
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:47,551
Terrible, yeah.

232
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:49,382
What do you eat
those things for?

233
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,480
- What, Health-Glo?
- There's no cashews. I love cashews.

234
00:10:52,524 --> 00:10:55,220
- They put no cashews in there.
- Yeah, you know who makes it?

235
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,750
- Who?
- Schwimmer's father.

236
00:10:56,794 --> 00:10:58,489
- You're kidding me.
- Swear to God.

237
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,896
- You ought to tell him to add cashews.
- I did.

238
00:11:00,932 --> 00:11:03,526
- Really? Wow, great, great.
- Yeah.

239
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:05,433
- Hey, Norm.
- Shalom, Jeff.

240
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,994
- Hey, Norm?
- Yeah?

241
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:10,301
Care for some, uh,
cashew-raisins?

242
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:12,969
No, I have
no appetite.

243
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:16,645
Hey, Norm, let me
ask you something.

244
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:22,148
I got a letter from the club
about having a dirty locker.

245
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:24,121
They don't like
dirty lockers.

246
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:26,282
- Yeah.
- You remember Burt Suzuki?

247
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:29,555
- Yeah.
- They kicked him out months ago.

248
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:32,654
- Filthy locker, filthy.
- Yeah, I was just kind of wondering

249
00:11:32,697 --> 00:11:35,461
maybe, if you had
anything to do with that?

250
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,990
- Me?
- Yeah.

251
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:39,503
No.

252
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:41,562
You sure?

253
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,030
Yeah.

254
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:14,667
- I'm very sorry.
- Thank you very much.

255
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:16,799
I'm very sorry.

256
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,741
Very sorry.

257
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:20,607
- Hi, Larry.
- Sorry about your uncle.

258
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:23,580
- Thank you very much.
- Very sorry.

259
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,649
Very sorry.
Sorry about your dad.

260
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:31,553
- Thanks, Larry.
- He was a good man.

261
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:33,853
He was a great man.

262
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:38,061
Maybe we'll play golf sometime,
when you're...

263
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:40,064
- Mm-hmm.
...feel better.

264
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:42,896
- If you feel up to it.
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:47,166
Sure you don't want to give
me that weatherman's tip?

266
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:49,605
Right now
I'm in mourning.

267
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:52,610
No, I'm not saying now,
but some other time, you know.

268
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:56,637
We'll talk about it.
Do what... do what you have to do.

269
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:01,512
What's with
the open casket?

270
00:13:01,552 --> 00:13:03,713
I know, why do we have
to go look at that?

271
00:13:03,755 --> 00:13:05,916
Hey, Jeff Rosenthal.

272
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:07,652
He was a writer
on "Party of Five."

273
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:09,387
- That guy, really?
- Yeah.

274
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:11,156
Go ask him.

275
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:15,298
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,233
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

277
00:13:17,268 --> 00:13:20,704
This is gonna sound a little crazy.
Did you work on "Party of Five"?

278
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:22,535
Yeah.

279
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:25,371
You remember the season
when Charlie had Hodgkin's?

280
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,900
Right.
Yeah yeah.

281
00:13:26,944 --> 00:13:30,311
So in the show, didn't
he have good Hodgkin's?

282
00:13:30,348 --> 00:13:34,284
Well, he had Hodgkin's
that he survived.

283
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:36,287
I don't know
if that's good.

284
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,016
He survived it,
so that was good.

285
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:41,048
But isn't there a good Hodgkin's
and a bad Hodgkin's?

286
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:44,823
No, there's Hodgkin's
and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

287
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:48,093
And Hodgkin's disease
has a better survival rate.

288
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:50,532
Okay, so that's
a better Hodgkin's.

289
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,832
I mean,
that's a valid point,

290
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,737
but I wouldn't say
it was good.

291
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:58,833
- It's better.
- It's better.

292
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:01,572
- Okay.
- But not good.

293
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:03,910
Better.

294
00:14:06,684 --> 00:14:08,481
Okay, there's two
kinds of Hodgkin's.

295
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,079
One has a better survival
rate than the other.

296
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:12,851
- Right.
- Okay, so it's good.

297
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,915
No, it's not good.

298
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,517
Well, it's better
than the other.

299
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:18,188
Okay, better,
but it's not good.

300
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:19,821
Compared to the other,
it's good.

301
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:37,610
- What?
- My 5-wood's in there.

302
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:39,445
- What?
- Go see for yourself.

303
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:40,951
It's my 5-wood.

304
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:47,183
- Oh my God.
- The fuck is my 5-wood

305
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:49,659
- doing in the casket?
- I have no idea.

306
00:14:49,694 --> 00:14:53,755
- He wanted to be buried with his club.
- Yeah?

307
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:57,290
Sven must have put my club
in there, probably on purpose.

308
00:14:57,335 --> 00:15:00,498
- That's a horrible thing to do.
- That club's irreplaceable.

309
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:03,666
- It's 10 years old. They don't make it.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

310
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,471
I'm sorry, man.

311
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:10,444
- You got your clubs in your trunk?
- Yeah.

312
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:13,946
- No, not... no no no.
- Why?

313
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:16,146
Because I like
the way mine feels.

314
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:18,815
Your club, I can get at
any store in the country.

315
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:21,256
- But I like the feel.
- It doesn't matter. It's one club.

316
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:23,385
- I like that club.
- Why should this guy

317
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:27,194
be buried in eternity with my club? That's
not fair.

318
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,257
That's not fair.
I'll buy you a new club today.

319
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:32,861
The exact same one.
And it better have the same feel.

320
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:46,308
My Uncle Leo was
more than my uncle,

321
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:47,902
he was like a second
father to me.

322
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:51,881
And he loved life, my Uncle Leo.
Didn't he?

323
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:55,613
He was a guy who
lived it to the hilt.

324
00:16:57,388 --> 00:17:00,255
Loved his only son Marty.

325
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,749
He loved a good walk.
Loved ginger-ale...

326
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:06,422
on ice with the fizz.

327
00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:08,830
- He liked driving his car.
- Hey.

328
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:11,198
- Hated to fly.
- Hey!

329
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:14,398
A short nap
in the afternoon; "Jeopardy."

330
00:17:14,438 --> 00:17:16,998
- Those of you that knew him.
- Look at that.

331
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,533
He loved
to frame the answers

332
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:23,308
- like questions, huh?
- It's disgusting.

333
00:17:23,347 --> 00:17:26,908
Every second Tuesday,
a haircut.

334
00:17:29,153 --> 00:17:31,917
I'm just gonna say goodbye
to my Uncle Leo.

335
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:36,356
Marty, come here
a minute.

336
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:43,327
Is this his 5-wood?

337
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:50,170
No. Someone must
have switched it.

338
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:56,477
What is that?

339
00:17:56,514 --> 00:18:00,041
- Is that a cashew?
- Yeah, it's a cashew.

340
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:27,744
We are kicked out
of our country club

341
00:18:27,778 --> 00:18:30,645
because of
a fucking 5-iron?

342
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:32,581
- It was a 5-wood.
- Jeffrey?

343
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:34,949
You didn't know the golf club
had your name on it?

344
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:36,681
Fucking idiot!

345
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:39,212
What are we supposed
to do now, all right?

346
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:41,224
Where's Cheryl
gonna play tennis?

347
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:44,625
- Good question. Where am I gonna play?
- Yeah, exactly.

348
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:47,096
I've been playing
at that club for years.

349
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:49,964
She's in the tournaments. She's one
of the best players in the club.

350
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:51,491
She's not that great.

351
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:53,628
Matter of fact, I am
and I think I proved that.

352
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:55,969
I beat her 6-1, 6-love

353
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,567
- two years ago.
- Two years ago!

354
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:00,406
And you're still
hanging onto that.

355
00:19:00,444 --> 00:19:03,675
You know how many times I've played
tennis since? You know what?

356
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:05,545
The truth of the matter is

357
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,279
Cheryl cares about that club,
I care about that club,

358
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,777
Sammi goes to day camp there with
the same kids she's been with for years.

359
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:13,847
You two don't give a shit
about anybody but yourself.

360
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:16,451
You're fucking
narcissists, okay?

361
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:19,793
It's all a game,
all a big fucking game.

362
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,230
- What are we gonna do?
- You're just so inconsiderate.

363
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,427
You don't think about
what's gonna happen next.

364
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:26,766
You know what?
That 5-wood was irreplaceable.

365
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:28,965
- Mine's replaceable.
- And I'll tell you,

366
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:31,236
I would rather be out of that club
with my 5-wood

367
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:35,006
- than in it without it.
- We'd rather you be in it without it.

368
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:37,344
We've no place to go,
no place to play.

369
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:39,645
It was our social life!

370
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:41,652
Okay, you know what?

371
00:19:41,686 --> 00:19:43,711
I think my friend Julie
was just saying

372
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:46,814
that the Beverly Park Country Club
might be taking new members.

373
00:19:46,857 --> 00:19:48,882
Beverly Park,
that's pretty...

374
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,951
And it's a beautiful
country club.

375
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:52,860
All right, I don't
want to offend you,

376
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:55,593
but there's, like, three
fucking Jews in the whole club.

377
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:58,193
It's not for us.
It's WASP, WASP, Republican city.

378
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:01,204
Okay, you know what?
I fit in with you guys all the time.

379
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:03,468
For years, I've been
going to your thing, so...

380
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:05,236
How am I gonna get by
in the interview?

381
00:20:05,276 --> 00:20:07,836
This one would stick out
like a sore fucking thumb.

382
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:10,813
- This Jew-face over here.
- I'm more of a Jew-face than you?

383
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:13,908
Hey, fuck you, Larry.
I didn't get us into this predicament.

384
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,977
- I'm much more gentiley than you are.
- Okay okay, look.

385
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:18,784
We get an interview,
we go in there.

386
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:20,723
- It's a great golf course.
- It is.

387
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:24,023
- They have a beautiful tennis court.
- But you know what?

388
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:26,621
You have to walk on that course.
There's no carts.

389
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:28,723
- We like to take a cart.
- I'm not joining.

390
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:30,825
It wouldn't hurt you
to walk a little, Jeff.

391
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:33,769
That's what it's all about.
You can't exercise a little bit?

392
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:36,295
I'd have to get a doctor's
note in order to take a cart.

393
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,104
- So get a fucking doctor's note!
- I don't know any doctor.

394
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:41,077
It's always
something with them.

395
00:20:49,553 --> 00:20:51,316
Oskie.

396
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:54,222
Hey, Oskie!
Come on.

397
00:20:57,828 --> 00:20:59,887
What's going on?
What are you doing?

398
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:03,963
Should I sit?

399
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,366
Yeah.

400
00:21:21,752 --> 00:21:23,583
The dog bit
my penis!

401
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:37,991
- Fucking dog should be put to sleep.
- He should be put to sleep.

402
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:40,833
- You think so too?
- He's biting people. That's dangerous.

403
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,668
He's never bitten
anybody before, ever.

404
00:21:42,706 --> 00:21:45,197
It's not the first time
with you and the dog. I know that.

405
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:48,575
What does that mean?
What happened with the dog?

406
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:52,013
- Tell her.
- Nothing happened with the dog.

407
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:54,040
Obviously something
happened.

408
00:21:54,084 --> 00:21:57,383
- He said it's not the first incident.
- He pet the dog before.

409
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:59,981
Dog was in his lap.
He got up, he had a boner.

410
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:03,887
Why did the dog
give you an erection?

411
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:06,892
And why didn't you
tell me about that?

412
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:09,798
First of all,
that's not true, okay?

413
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:12,894
- That's not true. I was petting the...
- Why would he say that?

414
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:15,906
- Because he's a moron...
- I'm making it up? What happened?

415
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,000
I was petting the dog,
and then the dog left

416
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:22,206
- and I got up and I adjusted my pants.
- Because you had an erection?

417
00:22:22,246 --> 00:22:24,271
No, because I just had
to adjust my pants.

418
00:22:24,315 --> 00:22:26,408
- And then Susie saw me.
- What was the dog doing to you?

419
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,419
Nothing, I was just petting it.
You see what you did?

420
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:32,081
- You see what you did now?
- Oh my God, wait a second.

421
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:35,023
Is that why Ted Danson
didn't want you to take care of his dog?

422
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,323
Mmm-hmm.

423
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,621
Oh, God, I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

424
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,464
Some privacy here.

425
00:22:45,502 --> 00:22:48,403
Okay, let me see.
I just got this.

426
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:50,805
I'm sorry, I haven't
really looked at it.

427
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:53,207
They checked you
in outside and, uh,

428
00:22:53,244 --> 00:22:55,940
you don't have any allergies
to medicines or...

429
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,448
- No no.
- You have a history of heart disease?

430
00:22:58,482 --> 00:23:01,110
High blood pressure,
eczema, anything like that?

431
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:03,619
- No no.
- Okay, good, good.

432
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:06,748
All right,
so what's the problem?

433
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:14,455
I, uh...

434
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:18,397
a dog, uh...

435
00:23:21,238 --> 00:23:25,470
- A dog?
- Bit me over there. Bit my penis.

436
00:23:27,111 --> 00:23:30,137
A-a dog bit
your penis?

437
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,614
Okay, well...

438
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,550
that sounds painful.

439
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:36,985
Sorry.

440
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:40,457
Let's see. Okay, Mr...
Larry David?

441
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,385
Oh my God.

442
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:47,090
Are you in
"The Producers"?

443
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,893
- Yeah.
- I'm best friends with Steve.

444
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:54,370
Steve, the choreographer
for "The Producers."

445
00:23:54,405 --> 00:23:56,669
Anthony?

446
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:58,231
Yes!

447
00:23:58,275 --> 00:23:59,742
Yes! He mentioned
me, then?

448
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:03,246
He's told me
a lot about you, actually.

449
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,545
He said that I think you love
to play golf and...

450
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,710
I golf too.

451
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:11,448
That's the only reason
I'm bringing it up.

452
00:24:12,923 --> 00:24:16,359
So, okay.
Well, I'll go all day if you let me.

453
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:18,418
Why don't you
give me "Mister Baggie"

454
00:24:20,097 --> 00:24:23,794
and just stand up and show
me what the dog did?

455
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:38,876
And he says to you,
"You got it out there,

456
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:41,282
- but it's low and to the right."
- Hello!

457
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:45,550
- Hi, Erin told us to come right in.
- Cheryl?

458
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:47,352
- Yes. Cheryl.
- Jim Rummington.

459
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:49,416
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, Jim. Larry.

460
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,655
- Larry?
- Larry David.

461
00:24:51,695 --> 00:24:54,323
- What a great pleasure to meet you.
- I'm sure it's ours.

462
00:24:54,365 --> 00:24:56,094
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

463
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:58,863
- Here you go, sweetheart.
- Thank you, darling.

464
00:24:58,902 --> 00:25:00,802
By the way,
gentlemen,

465
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:05,798
I must comment on how
friendly everybody was.

466
00:25:05,843 --> 00:25:08,573
- We just parked our Hummer in the lot.
- You have a Hummer?

467
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:11,137
- Oh yes.
- How do you like it?

468
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:13,308
Oh, I like it.

469
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,114
- It's very roomy.
- What a beauty.

470
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:18,644
I'm not too worried about
the global warming.

471
00:25:18,689 --> 00:25:20,782
People like it a little warmer,
don't they?

472
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:23,452
- Am I crazy here?
- By the way,

473
00:25:23,494 --> 00:25:25,462
where did you
go to school?

474
00:25:25,496 --> 00:25:27,589
New Haven.
I went to Yale.

475
00:25:27,631 --> 00:25:29,963
- Oh, I see, I see.
- Did you meet in school?

476
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,436
- Um, no, actually.
- Not really.

477
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,995
It's sort
of a May-December relationship.

478
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,803
I don't know
if you've noticed.

479
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:40,435
I would call it May-October.
I wouldn't say December.

480
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,041
No, we met
at a fundraiser.

481
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:47,141
- What was the fundraiser?
- It was for...

482
00:25:47,184 --> 00:25:48,913
- Ronald Reagan.
- Reagan.

483
00:25:48,952 --> 00:25:52,080
- Oh yeah? Oh I see.
- Yeah, we were both volunteering.

484
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:55,114
Just volunteering
our time and our effort.

485
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:57,787
Good for you.
Because when you're young,

486
00:25:57,828 --> 00:26:00,956
you have the energy
and the power to do those things.

487
00:26:00,998 --> 00:26:03,466
But now, that's
the interesting question,

488
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,765
- what do you do afterwards?
- Right.

489
00:26:06,804 --> 00:26:09,500
That's a good question.
What do you do after that?

490
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,509
- You maintain that kind of commitment.
- We come to a place

491
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:15,103
like this beautiful country club,
and we make...

492
00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:17,170
Magnificent, really.
Just magnificent.

493
00:26:17,214 --> 00:26:20,183
You feel
comfortable here?

494
00:26:20,217 --> 00:26:22,981
Oh, so at home.

495
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,817
Quite comfortable.

496
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:27,187
Let me say the golf course
is magnificent too,

497
00:26:27,224 --> 00:26:29,488
I'm fairly
new to golf.

498
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:33,121
- Polo was my game.
- Really?

499
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:35,097
Oh, well, I had
a terrible accident.

500
00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:36,793
I got hit with
a mallet in the head

501
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:39,769
and fell off the horse,
and unfortunately my polo days are over.

502
00:26:39,803 --> 00:26:42,863
But I found the swing
really works for golf.

503
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:45,636
- Yes, he's a natural.
- I picked it up right away.

504
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:47,803
You know, that's right.
It is a similar swing.

505
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:51,008
It's a similar swing.
Think about it, yeah.

506
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:53,346
By the way,
did I notice

507
00:26:53,383 --> 00:26:56,841
a log-cabin Republican
in the parking lot?

508
00:26:56,887 --> 00:26:59,185
Was that you?
Did you let that one in, Ken?

509
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,527
I thought we did.

510
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:06,358
Let me ask you a question.
What hobbies

511
00:27:06,396 --> 00:27:09,957
or social societies
have you been involved in?

512
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,491
That's a fair question.
Outside of golf of course,

513
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:15,869
- we like sailing.
- Yes, we sail as a pair.

514
00:27:15,906 --> 00:27:19,034
Got a schooner
down at the marina.

515
00:27:19,076 --> 00:27:21,442
A schooner in the marina?
That's marvelous.

516
00:27:21,478 --> 00:27:23,969
- You must know Baxter Churchill?
- Of course.

517
00:27:24,014 --> 00:27:25,982
- Yes yes.
- Sail it yourself

518
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:27,847
or do you have a captain?

519
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:32,345
Occasionally I'll bring
a captain in if it's windy.

520
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,448
Could I ask you a few
more questions

521
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:37,983
- about organizations you belong to?
- Absolutely.

522
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:40,292
Well,
I'm a Moose...

523
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,356
- and an Elk.
- You're a Moose and an Elk?

524
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,925
- I'm a Moose and an Elk, yes.
- That's extraordinary.

525
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:51,100
- I'm in the Rotary Club.
- Well, oh my.

526
00:27:51,141 --> 00:27:53,609
What other organizations
are you members of?

527
00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:56,977
We're on the Council
for Conservative Citizens,

528
00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:59,107
- National Right to Life Committee.
- Yes.

529
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:01,117
we're in the Heritage
Foundation.

530
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:02,743
I think this has gone
rather well.

531
00:28:02,786 --> 00:28:05,016
- Proceedings have come to an end.
- Great.

532
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:06,784
We've enjoyed
meeting you.

533
00:28:06,823 --> 00:28:10,315
- We've enjoyed meeting you.
- Gentlemen, before we go...

534
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,454
unfortunately because
of my polo accident,

535
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:16,933
I'm not able
to walk the course

536
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:18,901
and I'll have
to take a cart.

537
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:21,905
That's from my
personal physician.

538
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:24,169
- Oh, I see.
- One Anthony Parker.

539
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:27,006
Dr. Anthony Parker.

540
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:36,184
- Hello?
- Hey, Delilah, it's Larry David.

541
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,053
- Hi, Larry.
- I'm sorry,

542
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:41,148
but I'm not gonna be able
to make it tonight.

543
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:43,056
Why not?

544
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,653
A dog bit my penis.
