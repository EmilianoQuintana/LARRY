Episode 5x02 : The Bowtie

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,900
So then he goes like this...

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,800
I go, "what is it, dad?"

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,700
He goes... like this.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,700
He can't talk. He's in the hospital, the bed, you know?

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,100
So I lean in, and he whispers in my ear.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,200
And he says to me:

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
"you're adopted".

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,100
- He said that?
- I think he said that.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,100
Maybe he said, "you're a doctor". I don't know.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,600
But why would he say I'm a doctor? I would know if I'm a doctor.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,700
Why do you think he would wait until now to tell you?

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,200
Maybe he thought he was dying.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,800
But I'm still not 100% sure that he said it.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,900
So basically what you're saying is you want me to find out if you're adopted or not.

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,100
Yes.

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,900
First, how did you find me?

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,100
My friend said he read this big article about you in the L.A. Magazine.

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,300
"Best best private investigator in Los Angeles."

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Look, Mr. David, I have to be honest with you.

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,300
My business and what I do...

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,300
what I do is I service the community.

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,500
Basically what I'm saying is, I don't see a way that you would, uh,

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,800
be helping my community.

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,300
What about...

26
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,200
calling some bingo games or something?

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,100
You got, like, a community center for bingo?

28
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,100
Bingo's a distraction.

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,900
Don't underestimate bingo.

30
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,100
I've got extra sneakers that I don't wear anymore

31
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,800
- in pretty good condition, I must say.
- Extra sneakers?

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,600
I'd be more than happy to donate 'em.

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,100
Mr. David, I don't think this is gonna work.

34
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,600
It would mean an awful lot to me. Please please, think about it.

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,400
If there's anything I can do to convince you,

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,500
- I would.
- I can't promise anything.

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,300
What about a big brother kind of thing?

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,100
Let me talk to some of my community leaders

39
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,100
- and see exactly what the community needs...
- Yeah, okay,

40
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,100
I'm not talking about for a long time.

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,800
Maybe for one afternoon, to a movie or something.

42
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
Um, is that a key to the men's room?

43
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,900
Well, it says "men" on it. Yes.

44
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,900
It's a natural question to ask.

45
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,600
- Yes.
- May I borrow the key?

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,400
- Yes, you may borrow the key.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,900
Okay. Thanks, Mr. Jones.

48
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,900
- And you'll think about it?
- I will. By the way...

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,700
Love the bow-tie.

50
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,600
- What are you doing?!
- Using the bathroom.

51
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,100
That's my stall!

52
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,300
Did you see the plaque on it...

53
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,800
Yes, I know, but somebody was using the other one, so I...

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,400
Well, then you wait!

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,400
I couldn't wait. It was an emergency. I had to go!

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,600
There's one stall for me, and you're in it!

57
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,100
If you were here, I would have given you first dibs.

58
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,600
But honestly, I haven't seen a handicapped person in the bathroom, maybe ever.

59
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,900
So I thought I could perhaps take my chances.

60
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,900
"A handicapped person"?

61
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,200
That's nice. Oh, that's nice!

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,300
- It's called disabled. Disabled.
- Disabled?

63
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,500
Well, that doesn't sound so hot.

64
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,200
I don't really care what it sounds like to you, okay?

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,700
It's disabled.

66
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,600
I think I would prefer handicapped.

67
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,500
God, you know how archaic that word is? "A handicapped person"!

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,200
That's demeaning, don't you know?

69
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,600
- I'm a disabled person.
- Oh, sorry.

70
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,400
- You're sorry.
- Oh, sorry.

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Now you've learned a lesson. Please, don't ever go in my stall again!

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,600
- All right?
- Fine, okay.

73
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,700
- Thanks so much!
- You're welcome.

74
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,300
- I appreciate it.
- You're welcome.

75
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,300
Douche-bag.

76
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,000
So you think he's a muslim?

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,600
- He had the bow-tie.
- Huh?

78
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,100
Do black men who aren't muslims ever wear bow-ties?

79
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,500
- I haven't seen it.
- It'd be interesting to find that out.

80
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,700
- I'm surprised you didn't ask him.
- Yeah, me too.

81
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,800
I mean, you know, I don't care either way, I'm just curious.

82
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Well, I'll tell you something, that I think he's a muslim.

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,500
Hey, that's a handicapped spot.

84
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,800
Wh-wh-what?

85
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,100
What's with the walking?

86
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,600
F-f-fuck you!

87
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,000
I have a s-s-s-stutter!

88
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
Yeah, but you can walk.

89
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,100
Look at my l-l-license p-p-plate!

90
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,100
I have p-p-permission, you fucking p-p-prick!

91
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Oh hey...

92
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,000
we got a dog.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,200
Really? Why?

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,100
- She wanted a dog.
- You have to walk it and everything?

95
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,900
- I'm sure I'll wind up doing stuff.
- Oh, definitely.

96
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,900
I know, yeah, but you know what? It's kind of cute.

97
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,000
- Larry!
- I kind of like it. Hi!

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,900
- Jodi!
- How are you?

99
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,000
- Great, great.
- So good to see you!

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
- Great to see you.
- Hi Jodi.

101
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,100
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

102
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,300
Ms. Jodi Funkhouser...

103
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,300
- So what's going on?
- Nothing.

104
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,400
Seeking attention, getting rejected.

105
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,800
- Are those new glasses?
- No, but I cleaned them.

106
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,800
You're so funny!

107
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
- I'm here with my dad.
- Oh yeah?

108
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,900
Are you coming to my parents' 25th anniversary party?

109
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
I am.

110
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,800
- Oh. Are you?
- Eh...

111
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
It'll be fun, really. Think about it.

112
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,600
I'm not gonna think about it, but whatever.

113
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,400
- I really hope you come.
- Well, thanks.

114
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,000
- It's so good to see you.
- Good to see you.

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,300
- Wow, great to see you.
- Yeah. Bye-bye.

116
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
Bye.

117
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,000
All right, is it my imagination?

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,700
Does she like you that much or does she dislike me that much?

119
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Oh, lesbians love me. They love me.

120
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,900
- How is that?
- Well, when I first got to L.A.

121
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,900
You remember... you know Patty, my friend Patty.

122
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,500
- Patty, yeah.
- Well, she's a lesbian.

123
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
- Yes.
- You know, so,

124
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,200
obviously, they talk amongst themselves,

125
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,700
and the word got out that I'm a friend o' lesbians.

126
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,500
- You're a friend o' lesbians!
- Yes, they know that.

127
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,700
So the community has completely embraced you.

128
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,900
Totally embraced me.

129
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,200
Completely.

130
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,100
More so than any other community.

131
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,400
Including jews.

132
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,900
- Hi, two.
- Ready? This way.

133
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
Oh, jeez.

134
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,500
The men's room key from the private investigator's office.

135
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,300
I forgot to bring it back.

136
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,100
- I'm always doing that.
- Hey...

137
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,500
Check out the bow-tie here.

138
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
It's a smart look.

139
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,400
I think I'm gonna get me one of those.

140
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,500
You know what? You oughtta try wearing a bow-tie.

141
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,700
- It'd be a good look for you. Hi!
- Hi.

142
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,000
- How are you doing?
- Great!

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,900
Hey, thanks for sending the invite back.

144
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,000
- Oh, well sure. I'm excited.
- We're gonna have a blast.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,400
- It's gonna be... are you coming?
- Eh...

146
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
- Tell me you're coming. Please.
- I don't know.

147
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,500
25 years of marriage!

148
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,700
- Rosie's coming.
- Rosie O'Donnell?

149
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,900
And I have Larry David's place card right next to hers.

150
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,500
- Really? You're sitting me next to her?
- Right next to her.

151
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,900
- You know Rosie O'Donnell?
- I know her from New York.

152
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,200
- We used to hang out together doing comedy.
- You'll have a great time.

153
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,800
- Just send the invitation back, okay?
- Oh, thank you.

154
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,700
- I'll see you guys there. I'm excited.
- By the way,

155
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,200
- Jodie's really looking good.
- She does look great.

156
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,400
- Doesn't she look great?
- Oh, thanks a lot, yeah.

157
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,600
She's dating a guy. I think it's serious.

158
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,100
She's dating a guy?!

159
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
Yeah, she's no longer gay.

160
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,100
What? You're kidding! That's fantastic!

161
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,600
Congratulations! Good for you.

162
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,100
She's not a lesbian anymore.

163
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,800
Oh my god.

164
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Good going.

165
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,100
All right, I'll see you, uh, soon.

166
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,600
Yeah, I'll see you at the party.

167
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,600
Larry, we need to talk.

168
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
It's over?

169
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,600
What's over?

170
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
The marriage.

171
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
Why would our marriage be over?

172
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,900
You said, "we need to talk."

173
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,100
Yeah, we need to talk about Marty Funkhouser's party!

174
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,100
Oh, okay. I thought...

175
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,400
- eh, forget it.
- No no no, what did you think?

176
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Well, you know, you said, "we need to talk."

177
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,300
Generally, when couples break up, that's how they introduce it, you know, "we need to talk."

178
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,200
- So I just thought it was...
- Well, why would you...

179
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,000
why would you even think that?

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,300
Well, because women have broken up with me many times,

181
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,700
and they've always introduced it with "we need to talk."

182
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,600
So I'm just sort of conditioned for that response.

183
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,300
And when women broke up with you, did you light up like that?

184
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,300
Light up?

185
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,500
- Yeah.
- Did I light up?

186
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,700
"Oh, it's over?"

187
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,500
You know, it could have been a defense mechanism.

188
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,200
That's how I react to things.

189
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,100
I go the other way, so I don't get hurt. I protect myself.

190
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,500
You understand. So what about the party?

191
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,000
- Marty Funkhouser's party...
- Have you been thinking about this for a while?

192
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No! Not at all! No, of course not.

193
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,100
So what about the Funkhouser party?

194
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,300
Well, I wanted to know if we're going or not.

195
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,800
I need to send in the rsvp and...

196
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,400
I wasn't going, and now I've changed my mind.

197
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Rosie O'Donnell's gonna be there.

198
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Our table.

199
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,700
And you know what else?

200
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,700
I might wear a bow-tie.

201
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,100
- What do you think of that?
- You're gonna wear a bow-tie?

202
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,100
Are you loving that? Is that fantastic?

203
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,500
- How about that for an idea, huh?
- I, well...

204
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,000
You're gonna love it.

205
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,900
- Well, look who's here.
- Wanda!

206
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Look who's here.

207
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,300
- How are you doing?
- Welcome!

208
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,800
This is our new house.

209
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,700
What do you think?

210
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,900
- Oh, the rental house.
- This is a rental.

211
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,800
It's just for a few months until the renovation's done.

212
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,100
You know.

213
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,400
Shit, I mean, you're renting, so I can be honest.

214
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,200
- Yeah, yeah.
- I don't like it.

215
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,900
- Kinda cold, like a hotel.
- Yeah.

216
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,400
A hotel? Hotels are good.

217
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
You know, there's a lot of activity in the hotel lobby.

218
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,600
I think that's a good thing.

219
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,700
Why don't you put a little bellman's cap on...

220
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,600
- Okay, I'll put a bellman's cap on.
- ...and run around.

221
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,900
Put a little concierge desk over there.

222
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,900
- Hey, Wanda, let me ask you a question.
- What?

223
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:47,800
Is it wrong to assume that a black man wearing a bow-tie is a muslim?

224
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,900
Why are you asking me some bullshit like that?

225
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,200
What the fuck, Larry?!

226
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,100
I'm not your link into the black world, okay?

227
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,500
So stop asking me shit about black people and stuff, all right?

228
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,200
Okay, but let me ask you this:

229
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,400
Have you ever seen a black man wearing a bow-tie

230
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,900
who's not a muslim?

231
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,400
- Who gives a fuck?
- It's just something you may have observed.

232
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,100
- Have you observed...
- Larry, I don't...

233
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,700
- Have you ever observed a black man...
- Larry, I don't...

234
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,200
...who's not a muslim wearing a bow-tie? That's all.

235
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,500
You think farrakhan went out and bought up all the bow-ties or something?

236
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,900
He's sitting there holding on to bow-ties and only muslims get 'em?

237
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,100
What the fuck, Larry? You... what... no. I don't know.

238
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,200
Fair enough. Good answer. "I don't know."

239
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
I totally accept it.

240
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,500
- I got the dog.
- That's what I want to see.

241
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,300
- I know, you've got to see him. Sheriff!
- Sheriff!

242
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,300
- Hello boy!
- He's a cutie!

243
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
- What the hell...
- I think it's you, Wanda.

244
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
- One of y'all wanna grab cujo?
- Um...

245
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,100
Come on, it's just Wanda. It's just Wanda.

246
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,100
I'm sorry. He's very friendly.

247
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,900
We're all done in there.

248
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,300
Just, uh, you have to wait overnight for the...

249
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,500
Hey! Hey, little buddy. Come here.

250
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,000
What's wrong with your dog?

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,700
I don't know. See how friendly he is?

252
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,400
Good dog!

253
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,100
He probably smells my dog.

254
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,900
- Oh!
- Hey! Shit!

255
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,500
- Oh my god!
- God!

256
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Hey, come on!

257
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,300
Get over here.

258
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,100
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

259
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,300
What did you do?

260
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,200
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

261
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,300
I don't know what's going on.

262
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,600
- I've never seen him like this.
- I'm really sorry.

263
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,600
- You know what's going on.
- Huh?

264
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
You have a racist dog!

265
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,500
- That dog hates black people.
- Wanda.

266
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,600
Larry, you trained the dog to hate black people?

267
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,300
No, I didn't train it to hate black people.

268
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,800
Has it barked at any white people?

269
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,500
- No, he's... he's...
- He hasn't barked at any white people.

270
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,000
Exactly. Your dog is racist.

271
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,000
Sheriff's racist?

272
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,900
Sheriff?!

273
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,100
That's a perfect name for a racist dog.

274
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,100
Where did you get this dog, the klan meeting or something?

275
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,000
- Larry picked him out at the pound.
- The pound.

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,300
Sheriff the fucking dog that eats black people.

277
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,900
What the fuck, man?

278
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,600
I'll tell you what, y'all stay here and pet your crazy-ass racist dog,

279
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,100
but I am not bringing my black ass back up into this fucking hotel

280
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,100
until y'all get rid of that fucking klan dog.

281
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,700
Got a klan dog!

282
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,400
Looking at me like I'm a damn t-bone.

283
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,900
- I'll call you.
- Aw, shut up.

284
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
So, uh, we have three choices.

285
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,900
I'm sorry, the first that we have is a skirt steak...

286
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,000
Look, I can't... I can't hear you.

287
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,400
Sir, could you repeat that? What's that?

288
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,200
It's a skirt steak, sir, or stir fry,

289
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
uh, and that's...

290
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Excuse me. Excuse me.

291
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Excuse me,

292
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,900
could you just keep it down a little bit? We can't hear the waiter.

293
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,500
- We're trying to order.
- Keep it down?

294
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
- We're trying to hear the waiter.
- I'm trying to have a good time

295
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
with my family over here. Know what I mean?

296
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,600
I'm not keeping it down.

297
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,900
I'm sorry, we need to keep it down for Tucker Carlson over here.

298
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,700
"Keep it down"!

299
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,800
- Tucker Carlson?
- Tucker Carlson.

300
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,200
There's a chicken rotisserie and a portobello mushroom salad.

301
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,000
- Salad?
- Yeah, the portobello is cut up

302
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,300
onto mixed greens.

303
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,700
- Are you a vegetarian?
- Yeah, it depends.

304
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,700
- She is.
- Ok.

305
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,100
So that would sort of be the best choice. It's really good.

306
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,100
I'm gonna get the skirt steak. Want me to order for you...

307
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,000
- What do you want?
- Get me the chicken.

308
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,300
Excuse me.

309
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,300
Uh, I'll have the portobello, yeah.

310
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,300
- Hey, Sue.
- What?

311
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,400
What's with the snub?

312
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,800
Oh, come on, Larry.

313
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,100
You're acting like you don't know?

314
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,500
What? I don't know why... what?

315
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
What did I do?

316
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,400
All right, let me give you a clue, okay?

317
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Starts with a "J" and it ends with an "I".

318
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Jedi?

319
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,500
- You know...
- What?

320
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,200
It's Jodi, okay?

321
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,000
Wh-what did you hear?

322
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,100
Well, I heard that you just got so excited,

323
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,900
like you were so happy that she wasn't with women anymore.

324
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
- That's ridiculous.
- It's not ridiculous.

325
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,700
- I was happy for him.
- I don't know what's happened to you.

326
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,500
I wasn't really happy for him, I was pretending I was happy for him.

327
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,200
- Oh really?
- But that's all. I was just pretending.

328
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,500
- No no no no.
- No, I wasn't sincere. I wasn't sincerely excited.

329
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,100
- You're not being sincere now.
- No, now I'm being sincere.

330
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,700
You know, the lesbian community used to revere you.

331
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,200
- You used to be such a liberal guy, Larry.
- I'm liberal.

332
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
- No, you're not liberal.
- I am liberal.

333
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,400
Look what you look like. Look at the bow-tie.

334
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,700
The bow-tie... I just tried out a bow-tie, so what?

335
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,900
Excuse me, excuse me.

336
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,600
You know what? I'm sorry.

337
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,400
Don't even waste your time talking to this man.

338
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
This man is a racist.

339
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,300
He has a racist dog.

340
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,300
He has a dog that attacks black people.

341
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Okay, I do... the dog is racist.

342
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,100
- But I didn't train him to be racist.
- Larry, forget about it.

343
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,800
How do you know that?

344
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Because we talk, Larry.

345
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,400
Are you having fun or what?

346
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,200
What did you tell Jodi?

347
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,000
I told her you were just maybe a little overjoyous

348
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,100
at the fact that she was dating a boy.

349
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,200
- That's all I said.
- All the lesbians hate me now.

350
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
- Oh, so it's my fault?
- Yes it is!

351
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,800
- You celebrated!
- I was pretending to be happy for your benefit.

352
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,600
- I don't need benefit!
- You need benefit!

353
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,400
- What do I need benefit for?
- You need benefit.

354
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,200
I'm happy if Jodi's happy.

355
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,300
- You're really overblowing this whole thing.
- I don't think so.

356
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,800
- We're at a party.
- I don't like being snubbed by lesbians.

357
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,300
- It's not fair.
- It's their prerogative.

358
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,400
- I'm their biggest supporter.
- You're their biggest supporter?

359
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,400
- Yes I am!
- Well, they're in trouble then.

360
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,500
By the way, where's Rosie O'Donnell?

361
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,800
She's not here yet.

362
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,500
Sure you invited her?

363
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,700
She'll be here.

364
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,500
- When?
- Soon.

365
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay.

366
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,000
Dan, Danny, come over here. I want you to meet somebody.

367
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,100
This is Jodi's new boyfriend. This is Larry David.

368
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you doing?

369
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,600
- Have a good time.
- Okay.

370
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,200
Hey, by the way, you and Jodi...

371
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
- Fantastic, great news.
- Yeah, yeah.

372
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
- Pretty good.
- Yes it is indeed.

373
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,400
Pretty, pretty,

374
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
pretty, pretty good.

375
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,200
- Yeah.
- Terrific.

376
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,100
And to have to overcome the whole situation,

377
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,900
the whole sexual thing, you know?

378
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,800
Oh. Oh, there's nothing to overcome, really.

379
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Well, you know, the fact that she's been with women before you.

380
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,600
- I know...
- I'd be really intimidated by that,

381
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,800
because, you know, we really...
- Intimidated?

382
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Well, because we don't know what we're doing as much as the women know.

383
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,400
You know, it's their equipment. They own the equipment,

384
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,300
so they know what to do with it.

385
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,600
You know what's going on down there?

386
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,700
- I don't have any idea.
- I'd like to think I do.

387
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,100
That whole area is so mysterious to me, you know?

388
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,900
- I'm just saying it's...
- Well, I mean...

389
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
I'd be intimidated, I know that.

390
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,600
Yeah.

391
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,100
I always wondered, do you walk around in your bikini at home?

392
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,100
- The way he talks, you'd think that he's got...
- Hey.

393
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,700
I think I want to go home. Let's go home.

394
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,900
No, we haven't even had dessert yet.

395
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,800
So what? We don't need dessert. Come on.

396
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
Well, it's rude. You stay for dessert.

397
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,100
- Then you can go.
- So what, dessert? It's no big deal.

398
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,400
- We can just go. Come on.
- Why do you want to go home?

399
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,200
I need to use the bathroom.

400
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,900
- So go use the bathroom.
- I don't want to use this bathroom.

401
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,700
- I want my own...
- Why?

402
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,900
This project demands I get back to my base.

403
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
I need my base.

404
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,300
- We're not going home...
- What's the matter?

405
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,800
- Larry wants to go home...
- What...

406
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,900
to use the bathroom. It's like...

407
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,000
Cheryl, you need to tell the whole table?

408
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,900
- Why don't you make an announcement?
- Hold on here.

409
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,500
You've never done that with me at lunch?

410
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,100
- It's the craziest thing the world.
- It's ridiculous.

411
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,700
He can use this bathroom.

412
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
- That's what everybody...
- You're a gentile.

413
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,600
You'll go in the middle of fifth avenue. It's different for jews.

414
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,500
- No, you're at an affair.
- What?

415
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,200
You cannot leave an affair before the dessert is served.

416
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,500
What is this dessert thing? We don't have to leave after.

417
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,300
- We can leave before dessert.
- Better to leave after.

418
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,000
- No, you do not leave before dessert.
- Who made this up?

419
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
- Where's this rule?
- I haven't made 'em.

420
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Everybody here seems to know, but the rules don't apply to you?

421
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,200
What am I supposed to do? Sit here for four hours and be uncomfortable?

422
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,500
Should I go clean it for you before you go in there?

423
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,000
- It's not even the cleanliness.
- Okay, just go.

424
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,400
- It's not a cleanliness issue.
- We don't need to talk about your bathroom...

425
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,700
so just go.
- You're the one who's telling everybody

426
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,700
in the whole place!
- Just go!

427
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,600
Hey, where do you think you're going, pal?

428
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
What are you doing?

429
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,900
I'm g-g-g-going to the b-b-b-bathroom.

430
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,400
- I don't think so, that's a handicapped stall.
- We're waiting in line.

431
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,300
I have a s-s-s-stutter, you p-p-p-pricks!

432
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,600
- Stutter my ass!
- That's for people who can't walk.

433
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Oh, all right, fine, okay.

434
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,800
Oh, your stutter's gone, jackass!

435
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,300
- Give me a fucking break, asshole.
- Stupid ass.

436
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,500
All right, that sounds good.

437
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,300
All right, I'll see you in about 10-15 minutes.

438
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,300
All right, great.

439
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,600
Hey.

440
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,700
- I'll see you in a few hours.
- Huh? Few hours?

441
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,500
- Yeah.
- Where are you going?

442
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,500
I'm meeting Julie.

443
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,900
- Don't forget to take the dog out.
- Hello.

444
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Out? What do you mean? Out for a walk or out with me?

445
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,700
Hello, Mr. David.

446
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,500
- This is Omar jones.
- Oh, hi.

447
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,700
I gotta tell you, Mr. David, I was thinking about taking the case,

448
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,500
but I got a distressing call today about your behavior last night at the banquet.

449
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,300
What are you talking about?

450
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,600
According to one of the brothers, you said, "keep it down".

451
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,800
No no, all that happened was I was trying to order

452
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,000
and I couldn't hear the waiter because some of your brothers

453
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
were making too much noise at the next table, that's all.

454
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,900
How do you even know about this?

455
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,600
We talk, Mr. David.

456
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
We talk.

457
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,600
- Huh.
- And what about my bathroom key?

458
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,900
I'm really sorry about that.

459
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,700
I'm returning it today, I promise.

460
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,400
Well, like I said, I'm gonna have to think about it.

461
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Thank you.

462
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,100
How was everything?

463
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,200
- Pretty good.
- Great.

464
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Do you want coffee, dessert, on the house?

465
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,600
- On the house?
- Yeah.

466
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,900
I'll have a cupcake.

467
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,300
- Yeah, I'll take a dessert on the house.
- Okay.

468
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,800
- Fabulous. Thank you.
- Are those new glasses?

469
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,100
No, I just cleaned them.

470
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,700
It's nice to have you back, Larry.

471
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,500
You, my friend, are back in the lesbian bosom.

472
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,100
Wow.

473
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,200
- I'm back.
- You are back.

474
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
By the looks of things, better than ever.

475
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,400
But what... I wonder what turned it around.

476
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,100
Oh dear. Uh-oh.

477
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,400
What?

478
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,600
- What does Funkhouser want?
- I don't know.

479
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,100
I'll be right back. How did he even know I was here?

480
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,500
What did you say to Dan?

481
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,000
What did I... hello, boy.

482
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,500
- Did you meet Sheriff, my dog?
- No, I didn't.

483
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,200
I said, "Dan, this is Larry David".

484
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,100
Then I left you.

485
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,500
And I said hi, I said hello, I said, "hi, Dan".

486
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Yeah, what else?

487
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,900
You know, a little small talk, "hi, how are you doing?"

488
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,300
"Where are you from?" and all that.
- That's it?

489
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:27,200
And then, what did I say? I said, "it must be hard, as a guy, to follow..."

490
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,600
Why didn't you just say, "hello Dan, I'm Larry".

491
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,300
- I said that after hi.
- "Nice to meet you"?

492
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,700
I said hi, then I said that.

493
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,500
- What is wrong with you?
- Problem?

494
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,900
Yeah, problem. Now she's back with a woman.

495
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,600
No wonder why they're all being so nice to me in there.

496
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,900
They're all smiling at me. Of course, it makes perfect sense.

497
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,100
- I want to say something else.
- Uh-huh.

498
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,100
You left my party before dessert!

499
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,600
How can you do that?!

500
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,400
It's not proper etiquette!

501
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I don't subscribe to the wait-for-dessert rule

502
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,700
before you can leave a party.

503
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,700
Yeah, no one cares what you subscribe to, okay?

504
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,500
We were trying to recreate what happened 25 years ago,

505
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,400
and I said, "Larry, would you like to make a toast?"

506
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,400
And someone said, "Larry went home to take a shit."

507
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,000
You stay here.

508
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Okay, boy?

509
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,900
You stay, Sheriff.

510
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,800
- Hey!
- Hey, Larry.

511
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,500
- Hey, hi!
- How are you?

512
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
- Great.
- Good to see you.

513
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,200
Hey, by the way, I don't know if you heard anything

514
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,400
about what's been going on...

515
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
- Oh, come on, I heard. Right? I'm in the loop.
- Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah.

516
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,700
It's all right, though.

517
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,700
I don't think you should worry about it. Just...

518
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,100
it's all good now.

519
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
You know, what happened that day was

520
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,900
- I just got a little excited, but not...
- Hey hey hey hey, Larry.

521
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,300
I stood up at the meeting, I told everybody, "I know the guy."

522
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,100
I vouched for you. You're all right.

523
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,700
- You're something, you know that?
- Come on, come on!

524
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,500
- It all worked out, right?
- It's great.

525
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,600
- Listen, she's happy, we're happy, you know?
- Fantastic.

526
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,900
She's back on the team. Everything's good. Don't even think about it.

527
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,900
- Fantastic.
- All right.

528
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,100
- Hey.
- Yeah.

529
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,000
You know, we missed you at Funkhouser's party.

530
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,500
The what?

531
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,500
Marty Funkhouser's 25th anniversary party.

532
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
- Oh, Jodi's dad?
- Yeah.

533
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
Yeah, I don't really know him. No.

534
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
- You weren't invited to that?
- Nope, no no no.

535
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,300
Was it good? Did you go?

536
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,200
- Yeah, yeah, I went.
- Yeah, it was good?

537
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,500
And don't worry about that other thing.

538
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,200
I just want you to know, gone, like it never happened.

539
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,300
- Okay? Like it never happened.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

540
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
- All the lesbians love you.
- Okay, love you.

541
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,900
- I love you back.
- Love you. I love you.

542
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Everyone loves you. All of us.

543
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,800
You are a muslim!

544
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,400
Go, pray, pray.

545
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,400
Let me ask you something.

546
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,200
Are brothers and sisters a little overly sensitive to being told to keep it down?

547
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Because I know in the movies you guys tend to make a lot of noise sometimes.

548
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,600
Am I right?

549
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,000
'Cause that's kind of what happened at the party.

550
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,300
What, did I... no, go back.

551
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,700
Did I interrupt the praying?

552
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
I'm sorry.

553
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,300
- Don't worry about it.
- All right.

554
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,300
- Listen, Mr. David...
- Look at the way you fold that up.

555
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,900
It's like a yoga mat, huh?

556
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,700
I just want you to know that muslims are a very forgiving people.

557
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,500
They are?

558
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,500
- Yes we are. We're very forgiving.
- Really? Huh.

559
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,800
Well, it's true.

560
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,800
There's a lot of meshugana muslims, though, running around, are there not?

561
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,000
Being that we are a forgiving people, I have decided to take on your case.

562
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,000
But I'm gonna have to charge you a higher rate than I charge most people.

563
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Well, whatever you have to do.

564
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,400
- You're gonna take the case?
- I'm gonna take the case.

565
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,800
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

566
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,300
Do muslims shake?

567
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,300
- Yes, we do.
- You do?

568
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,100
- Yes, we do.
- Great.

569
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,500
To tell you the truth, I'm very excited about this.

570
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,800
The whole adoption thing...

571
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,200
I mean, this could be a huge thing for me.

572
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,400
All right, Mr. David.

573
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,700
Oh, guess what.

574
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
Bathroom key.

575
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,700
You know what?

576
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,300
I gotta go again.

577
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,200
I'm so sorry.

578
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
All right.

579
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,100
Well, look at here!

580
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
Look what's doing here!

581
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,100
Aren't you supposed to be in here?

582
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,500
It seems to me you're using the wrong toilet, am I...

583
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Somebody was in there, I had to use the normal one

584
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,700
Really? First of all...

585
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,000
we don't like to be refered to as "normal", ok ?

586
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,000
We're able-bodied!

587
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,400
Able-bodied, not normal.

588
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,700
That's like from the eighties, who doesn't know that?

589
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,000
I had to go to the bathroom, somebody was in there.

590
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,600
Well then you wait.

591
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,100
You wait!

592
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,300
All right, Sheriff!

593
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,500
Ok, good boy!

594
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,400
- Good boy.
- Mr. David?

595
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,000
My bathroom key?

596
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
- Hey, nice dog!
- No, don't!

597
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,100
I love dogs, I have a couple on my own.

598
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,300
- All right, just give me my key.
- Oh...

599
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,100
- I can't believe I forgot.
- Or we'd have to keep going to the same thing,

600
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,400
you know
- I'm sorry. Won't happen again.

601
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,900
Won't happen again.

602
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,500
- Nice dog!
- Thank you.

603
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,000
Good to see you.

604
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,800
Hey, good boy, good boy yeah!

605
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,700
Oh look, you got yourself a doggy.

606
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
Sorry.
