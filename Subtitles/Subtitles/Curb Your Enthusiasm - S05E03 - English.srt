Episode 5x03 : The Christ Nail

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,500
How do those feel to you ?

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, they feel pretty good.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,100
I kinda like these orthotics.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,100
Yeah, they're really going to help.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,900
Boy, they sure make a lot of noise.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,200
They take a while to work in.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,400
Ah, Jesús !

9
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,900
How are you ?

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,100
- Everything okay ?
- Si.

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,100
Yeah ?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,700
You seem a little down.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,900
No, I.. I okay.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,300
- You okay ?
- Si.

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,900
Can you do me a favor ?

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,800
Small favor, okay ?

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,000
Small favor... it's hardly even a favor.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,600
You work here, actually, so it's part of your job.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,500
Either way, it's still a favor. Okay.

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,200
So I got, uh...

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,800
see this thing ?

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,500
It's a mezuzah.

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,800
Got that ?

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,600
And I need you to put it

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
over the door here.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,700
This is like a jewish thing.

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,800
You know, we put it over the door

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,100
so every anti-semite in the neighborhood will know that we live here

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,900
in case they wanna burn down the house.

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,600
Anyway, you just need a nail.

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,300
Get a nail, hammer and a nail,

32
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,200
- put it up.
- Si, mezuzah.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,300
Yeah, mezuzah.

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,700
I don't... I don't know what it does, really.

35
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,500
But anyway, because my father's coming to visit,

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,300
he'll be upset if he doesn't see it up there.

37
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,200
He's a little hard-of-hearing, so when you talk to him, talk loud.

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,800
He's losing his hearing.

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,300
- Okay ?
- Okay.

40
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,600
So you just speak up a little bit

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,700
"Hello, hello !" You know.

42
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,200
- "Hello ! Hello !"
- Yeah, "How do you feel, Mr. David ?"

43
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
"How do you feel, Mr. David ?"

44
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,100
That's good. That's good, Jesús.

45
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,100
By the way, Jesús... Jesus... either one ?

46
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,100
Either one, si.

47
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,800
It's okay.

48
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,900
- Same thing.
- Si.

49
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,600
Okay, okay.

50
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
- I do mezuzah.
- Okay, great.

51
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,200
What happened to your leg ?

52
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,700
It hurts on the bottom of my feet.

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,500
I have the exact same thing !

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
Do you want your life changed, Jesus ?

55
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,100
Huh ? Okay.

56
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,500
See this ?

57
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,900
It's called an orthotic.

58
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,900
Just put 'em in the bottom of your shoe,

59
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,100
and that's it.
- No no no, I do the mezuzah

60
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Try them on !

61
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,400
Tell him, Maria.

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,700
Honey...

63
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,400
What could it hurt ? It make you feel better.

64
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,600
- Okay.
- All right, okay, there you go.

65
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,100
- Okay.
- It's a good idea. Gracias, Mr. Larry.

66
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,000
- De nada.
- Thank you.

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
De nada.

68
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
De naaadaaa.

69
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,500
- What is that noise ?
- I don't know.

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,500
- Hey.
- Is that you ?

71
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,300
- What ?
- What's that noise ?

72
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,600
Oh, the orthotics.

73
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,800
- What ?
- Loud !

74
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Well, you gotta break'em in. It takes a little time.

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,900
They're really loud.

76
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,000
Well, they're very good for my feet, I could tell you that.

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
- My feet feel a lot better.
- That's good.

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,600
Let me ask you something :

79
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,900
Why is it that before you have a meal,

80
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,700
you do the whole cross thing,

81
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,400
but not for snack.

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,500
I don't think it applies to snacks.

83
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,300
I guess, otherwise you'd be crossing all day long.

84
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,500
There's gotta be a maximum number of times somebody can cross in a day.

85
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Uh, I wonder what the record is.

86
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,500
Have you ever seen any crossing on a snack, ever ?

87
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,900
- I don't think so.
- Excuse me.

88
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,900
I'm gonna be on the lookout for people who cross before snacking.

89
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,500
- What's that ?
- This ?

90
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,800
This is a nail.

91
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I bought this on the internet. It's from "The Passion of the Christ".

92
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,100
- What, are you kidding ?
- No.

93
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,400
- Kind of interesting...
- You got one of those Christ nails from the movie ?

94
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,300
Have you seen it ?

95
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,600
I didn't see it.

96
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,200
- All right, you must...
- I missed "Passion of the Christ".

97
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,700
- We have it on dvd, we can send it to you.
- Wish I could have gone.

98
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,600
They have all kinds of things in the internet for "The Passion of the Christ".

99
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,000
You're nuts about this Jesus guy, aren't you ?

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,100
Well, I have a personal relationship with Christ.

101
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,200
- Really ?
- Kinda... yeah.

102
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,500
I can see worshipping Jesus if he were a girl.

103
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,900
Like if god had a daughter... Jane.

104
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,200
I'll worship a Jane.

105
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,000
- No.
- But, you know, to worship a guy...

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,400
it's like a little kinda, you know, it's a little gay, isn't it ?

107
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,000
- Okay.
- The son of god ! What's the matter with you ?

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,900
No, I'm just saying. A girl...

109
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,500
I would worship Jane... if he had a daughter Jane,

110
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,000
- I could have a relationship with a Jane.
- He didn't have a daughter !

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,700
It's a shame it wasn't a girl. That's all I have to say.

112
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,700
Good-looking woman, zaftig, you know ?

113
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,500
- Good sense of humor.
- That's fine.

114
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,600
- If he had a daughter, everybody...
- We got it.

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
- everybody would worship Jane.
- Stop it.

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,100
That's all I'm saying.

117
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
- Larry ?
- What ?

118
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,000
What are you doing ?

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,900
What ? Nothing.

120
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,700
I was... your bra was kind of...

121
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,700
it was about to fall off and I was... I was putting it back on.

122
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,400
All right, and...

123
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,400
I felt like you were looking at...

124
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,000
my size.

125
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,100
I...

126
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,600
well...

127
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,800
I didn't deliberately set out to look at the size,

128
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,900
but I was... I had the bra in my hand,

129
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,500
and it's kind of like, you know, if you have a driver's license

130
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
you check out the date of birth. That's all.

131
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,100
- Okay.
- I checked it out.

132
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,000
And what'd you think ?

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah....

134
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Okay, it was good.

135
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Well, while we're on the subject,

136
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,500
I think we're gonna have to let Maria go.

137
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,200
- I cannot...
- Really ?

138
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,200
stand to watch her

139
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,800
clean room to room without a bra.

140
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
It's very distracting.

141
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,900
I know, but that's a big move.

142
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,900
You know, why don't you just tell her to put a bra on ?

143
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,200
I'm not gonna have that conversation with someone.

144
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,700
I would rather just get rid of her.

145
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,600
- We'll find somebody else.
- Really ?

146
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,300
First of all, she makes the best chicken salad.

147
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,500
I would really miss that.

148
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, Larry, then you're gonna have to tell her to wear a bra or fire her.

149
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
- If I see...
- All right, I'll... I'll tell her.

150
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
- I'll tell her to put the bra on.
- Okay.

151
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
I'll talk to her. I'll talk to her, no problem.

152
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,800
- All right. I got it.
- You done with this ?

153
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
- Yeah, I am.
- You done ?

154
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,700
Oh hi, I thought you were Jesús !

155
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,300
Jesús ! No kidding.

156
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Yeah, his shoes sound like your shoes.

157
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,200
- Yeah ?
- Yeah, they're very loud.

158
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
They make a lot of noise. You gotta break them in.

159
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,700
Yeah, but his feet feel really good.

160
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,100
- They're better ?
- Si, yeah.

161
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,600
- Fantastic !
- Yeah, thank you.

162
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,100
- That's unbelievable.
- It's good.

163
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,700
- They fit and everything ?
- Mm-hmm !

164
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,300
- Is he happy ?
- Yes.

165
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,200
'Cause you know, between you and me,

166
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
he could be quite a downer this guy, this Jesús.

167
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,700
Yes, I know.

168
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,400
He's good.

169
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,900
- Maria ?
- Yeah ?

170
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,000
I got a little thing I need to talk about with you.

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,900
Okay.

172
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Cheryl and I were having a conversation the other night.

173
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,300
Well, last night, actually.

174
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,700
You know, we couldn't help but notice that, uh,

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,500
you don't wear a, uh...

176
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,000
bra.
- Oh, no. Don't like 'em.

177
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Not for me.

178
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,500
- Not for you ?
- No.

179
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,200
Because, you know I got my father-in-law here.

180
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,100
- They're kind of distracting.
- Distracting ?

181
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,900
Yeah, a lot of flopping going on.

182
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,100
- No, they don't flop...
- There's floppin' !

183
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,200
Don't like the support things, they're uncomfortable.

184
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,000
I haven't worn one in 15 years.

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,100
They've made some great technological advances in bras in 15 years.

186
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,500
They're inviting and cozy and cottony.

187
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,100
What do you call that cotton ?

188
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,300
Puma ?

189
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,400
That's a sneaker.

190
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,800
All right... pima ! Pima !

191
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,200
No, I don't like 'em.

192
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,800
You don't like 'em.

193
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,500
All right, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you.

194
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,100
I'm gonna buy you a bra, how about that ?

195
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll buy you one, you'll try it, you'll put it on, you'll see...

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,100
you'll see what I'm talking about.

197
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,600
My treat.

198
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,900
- Okay, I'll try it.
- You'll try it !

199
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,900
I'll just try it on and just... let's see.

200
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm gonna get you a bra.

201
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,700
Where are you ?

202
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,200
I'm in the kitchen.

203
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,100
What the hell is that ?

204
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,900
Oh, my orthotics.

205
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,000
What's the story with that ?

206
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,500
Well, I got these new orthotics, you know...

207
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,900
- Is it always gonna sound that way ?
- No, no, you need to break 'em in.

208
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,300
- Okay...
- But my foot... !

209
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,700
- Good night, nurse.
- Really ?

210
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,200
- Yeah.
- How about that ? Congratulations.

211
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Thank you. Thank you.

212
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,500
- Beer ?
- Hmmm. Maybe later.

213
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
All right, well, if you want one, I haven't been able to find my can opener.

214
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,200
I'm telling you something.

215
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I got a housekeeper who steals.

216
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,700
- Really ?
- Oh yeah.

217
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,800
So it's just a can opener, you might not think it's much.

218
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
But everything I look for, gone !

219
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,600
- Why don't you fire her ?
- 'Cause I don't know for sure.

220
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,700
But I'm pretty sure.

221
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,100
Gee, I hate to hear that.

222
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,800
I know, it's horrible.

223
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,100
Of course, my housekeeper, I had to tell her to wear a bra.

224
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,400
You had to tell your housekeeper to wear a bra ?

225
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
I am buying her !

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,200
I have to buy her a bra.

227
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,700
I just don't know what size she is.

228
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Honey...

229
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,000
- Sammi's last tooth finally fell out.
- Oh, great, great !

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,300
Look at that, huh ?

231
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,400
Yeah, tooth fairy'll be coming tonight.

232
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,600
What ? Wait a second, what is this ?

233
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,300
What, tooth fairy.

234
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,700
- Tooth fairy ?
- Yeah.

235
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,900
What, are you kidding ? She's like 11 years old.

236
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,800
It's none of your god damn business, Larry.

237
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,700
Her tooth falls out, we stick it under her pillow.

238
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,000
Tooth f... She still...

239
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,100
She still believes in the tooth fairy ?

240
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes, she still believes in the tooth fairy.

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What's the matter with that ?

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,500
- Really ?
- Yeah.

243
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,300
Jesus Christ, I'm shocked.

244
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,800
What's so shocking ?

245
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
You don't understand children.

246
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,900
You don't know child psychology, and what they believe and don't believe.

247
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,300
- I guess I don't.
- No !

248
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,900
I knew there was no tooth fairy even before my teeth fell out.

249
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,700
Really ? Well maybe that's what your problem is.

250
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,000
Maybe if you had a little faith or belief in something,

251
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,900
you wouldn't have ended up the way you did,

252
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,900
you know ?

253
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
What are you looking at ?

254
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,700
What ? No, nothing.

255
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,900
All right. Thanks for your help.

256
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,600
Yeah, my pleasure.

257
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,200
- It's always something.
- Do me a favor ?

258
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,900
For the rest of the night, just leave us alone.

259
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
- Fine, my pleasure.
- Thank you.

260
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
- You know what ?
- What ?

261
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,200
I think she's about the same size as Maria, my housekeeper.

262
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,700
- Really ?
- Yeah.

263
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,700
- You know what size she is ?
- No. I can find out.

264
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,800
- Would you ?
- Sure.

265
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,500
- Thank you, thank you.

266
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,800
- Do you know what Cheryl's size is ?

267
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
I just found out, and I gotta tell you something.

268
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,600
- A little disappointed.
- Really ?

269
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
- Yeah !
- What, "B" cup ?

270
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
- I'd rather not say.
- "C" ?

271
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,900
- I can't, you know... I can't.
- 32 ? 34 ?

272
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,300
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Come on.

273
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,400
I don't want to talk about it.

274
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,100
- Come on !
- No ! I'd rather not.

275
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,200
I'm giving you Susie's bra size, give me Cheryl's bra size.

276
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,700
It's a trade.

277
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,800
- I can't, I don't want to.
- You know what ?

278
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,800
You don't tell me Cheryl's, I ain't telling you Susie's.

279
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,400
- Okay.
- Okay.

280
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,300
- Fine.
- Fine.

281
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,900
I'm not the one who has to go out and buy a bra.

282
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
- I don't give a shit.
- Oh, yeah, you do.

283
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,100
It's unbelievable, isn't it ?

284
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,400
I could be general manager of a basketball team.

285
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,800
- No, you couldn't.
- I could put together a better team...

286
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,100
- You could not.
- Don't tell me I couldn't !

287
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,800
You don't have a clue.

288
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,400
Half the things you say here on the couch...

289
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,900
I know as much about basketball as these idiots.

290
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,800
I just need the opportunity.

291
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,400
That's all, just the opportunity.

292
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,500
A young, fresh kid out of college just needs the opportunity.

293
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,700
- I do !
- That's all.

294
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,200
- I know I could do it.
- Yeah, yeah...

295
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
- Where're you going ?
- Bathroom.

296
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
What are you doing ?

297
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,200
What are you doing with that money ?

298
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,900
I was checking to make sure the tooth fairy left it.

299
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,100
You're lying ! You're a liar !

300
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,600
You're the tooth fairy ! There is no tooth fairy !

301
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,200
- Honey, there is a tooth fairy.
- You're lying ! It's you !

302
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,300
I'm gonna kill him !

303
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,600
It's you ! You're the tooth fairy !

304
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
- You know what you just did ?
- What ?

305
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,400
Sammi caught me putting the money under her pillow.

306
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,200
Because you woke her up with those things in your shoes,

307
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,500
- and now she knows that I'm the tooth fairy.
- Really ?

308
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,900
- The shoes woke her up ?
- Yes, the shoes woke her up !

309
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,900
She knows that there's no tooth fairy now !

310
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,900
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry ?

311
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,100
I'm her mother ! Trust !

312
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,800
I know, but it had to happen eventually.

313
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,300
You know, you're a stupid fucking idiot ! I cannot listen to this !

314
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,500
Jeff, do you hear this ?

315
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,700
- No what's going on ?
- "It had to happen eventually."

316
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,100
- What had to happen ?
- His orthotics, whatever the hell they are,

317
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,500
the noise woke Sammi up.

318
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,300
What's with your farchadat shoes ?

319
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
I told you it takes a while to break 'em in.

320
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,600
What are you breaking 'em in in my house for ? It's crazy !

321
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,500
Uh, you know it's... Hey look...

322
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,300
let me just posit this, okay ?

323
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,500
It might be a blessing in disguise.

324
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,900
- How ?
- The kid's 11 years old already.

325
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,300
- Enough with the tooth fairy !
- Not your business, Larry,

326
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,900
you misanthropic moron !

327
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,000
Not for you to judge !

328
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,700
She's our kid, we decide when she knows about the tooth fairy !

329
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,500
Maybe you shouldn't have propagated this ridiculous myth !

330
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,100
Get the fuck out of my house !

331
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,600
- You sure ?
- Yes !

332
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Hey, what's going on ?

333
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,400
What is it ?

334
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,700
Larry, get rid of those orthotics !

335
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Now I'll never get back to sleep !

336
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,400
May I help you ?

337
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Yes, hi, um...

338
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,900
yeah, I'm interested in, um...

339
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,200
in buying a, uh...

340
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
...bra.

341
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,300
- For your...
- It's not for me, no.

342
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,200
For your sweetheart or your wife ?

343
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,200
- Girlfriend ?
- Actually, my housekeeper.

344
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh, housekeeper, okay.

345
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm not making it up. It's really not for me.

346
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,100
Fine, no it's not... of course it's not for you.

347
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
- Tell me you believe me.
- I believe you, of course not !

348
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,700
Not that there's anything wrong with it.

349
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,600
- No because I know...
- But there is something wrong with it.

350
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
What am I saying ? There's a lot wrong with it.

351
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,200
- You can't say that in this day and age.
- I like to walk around

352
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,900
with underwear on my head. Is there anything wrong with that ?

353
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,600
Is there something wrong with that ?

354
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,400
- Yeah, there's something wrong with that.
- That's very funny.

355
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,800
- So you really do need a bra, then ?
- Yes.

356
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,600
Something comfortable. She hasn't worn one in 15 years.

357
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
- Not a french maid outfit ?
- No, it's not a lacey french maid outfit.

358
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,300
- 'Cause we have lots of those.
- This feels very nice.

359
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,600
- Yes, this is our revolutionary "elasticene".
- Yeah.

360
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,900
- This is the one...
- Lovely.

361
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,400
This is the best bra we make.

362
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,000
It's so soft, I like that.

363
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,300
- I like that.
- In fact, this one...

364
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
I wonder if they make underwear out of this stuff.

365
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,200
They do. We have matching panties.

366
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,300
No, for me, for men.

367
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,700
See, that's what I'm saying.

368
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,700
Feel free to try on anything here that you want.

369
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,500
Are you out of your mind ?

370
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
I'm not saying it's for me. It's not for me.

371
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
I'm just saying this kind of foamy, soft material

372
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,700
would be nice down there for me.

373
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,200
It's so smooth, yes.

374
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
That doesn't make me a pervert just 'cause I want to wear...

375
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,000
- There's nothing perverted about it !
- underwear made out of a bra.

376
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,800
That doesn't make me a pervert !

377
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Let's start...

378
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Let's figure out what this woman has...

379
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Got a good selection for you here.

380
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,800
And uh, you know the only issue, of course, is the size,

381
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
which I have to say I didn't really know your size.

382
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,000
I got a feeling I think I nailed it.

383
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,200
I really do !

384
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Okay, try them all on.

385
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,600
- All right ?
- Thank you, Mr. David.

386
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,100
All right, you're welcome.

387
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,900
You're a sick fuck, you know that ?

388
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,000
What are you talking about ?

389
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,800
What are we talking about ?

390
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,000
You know, our housekeeper's been stealing, Larry,

391
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,300
so we installed cameras throughout the house.

392
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Laundry room. I looked at the tape.

393
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,700
Quite a show, Larry. Look familiar ?

394
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,100
All right, so, I'm looking at the size of it.

395
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,400
I needed to buy a bra for the housekeeper,

396
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,800
and it seemed like you two were the same size.

397
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
So I needed to find out what your size was !

398
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,800
And what's all this mincing around ?

399
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,700
What is this ?

400
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
I was trying to imagine what it would be like

401
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,900
to be the housekeeper and have those breasts

402
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,300
you know, working and doing dishes.

403
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,500
And how did that feel ? Did it feel good ?

404
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,500
This is how your housekeeper washes dishes, like this ?

405
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,700
Huh ? That's what she does ? She dances, mincing around, washing dishes ?

406
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,400
Why are you looking at her breasts ?

407
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
I don't understand why you would walk into her laundry room

408
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,300
and start rifling through her underwear.
- I just happened to see the bra there,

409
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,900
so I thought, hey look at that,

410
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,900
she seems to be about the same size as Maria !

411
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,400
That's what you're doing ? Staring at everyone's breasts ?

412
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
- Yeah, exactly !
- No, I knew I had to buy her a bra and I thought...

413
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,700
Why are you buying her a bra ?

414
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,200
You don't have to buy her a bra !

415
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,300
You made me get a bra for her in the first place !

416
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,100
I never said go buy her a bra !

417
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,200
- What is wrong with you ?
- You wanted her to put a bra on,

418
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,000
and I was just fine...

419
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,700
You don't walk around looking in...

420
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,100
- It's disgusting.
- Keep you goddamn hands off my brassiere !

421
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,700
This isn't the first time it's happened.

422
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,900
The other day he's rifling through my things

423
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,100
looking at my labels.

424
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,900
We've been married 11 years.

425
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,400
So I took a little peek at her bra size, big deal.

426
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,200
So sue me ! Lock me up !

427
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,700
Pervert ! You sick fuck pervert !

428
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,900
- You have some fetish about bras...
- Oh get out of here !

429
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,600
with the housekeeper, with Cheryl, with me...

430
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,200
- Get out !
- I don't know what the hell it is,

431
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,300
but it's sick and you better fix those goddamn shoes too !

432
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,500
'Cause you know what he did ?

433
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,200
He woke Sammi up the other night,

434
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,100
I was putting money under her pillow because her tooth fell out.

435
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,300
- She caught me, now she knows...
- Yes, because there is no fucking tooth fairy !

436
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,300
- And It's about time she learned that !
- None of your business !

437
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,600
Where have you been ?

438
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,100
Bra shopping.

439
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,600
Okay, Mr. Larry ?

440
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
- It's nice ?
- Very nice !

441
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,400
- It's good, huh ?
- Very nice indeed !

442
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,800
- I like it !
- You like it ?

443
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,100
It's nice, it feels good.

444
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,600
- Good.
- Yeah, it feels nice.

445
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,800
What's with him ?

446
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,700
Oh, he didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

447
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,700
He was woken up and now he's very tired today.

448
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,500
What's the mezuzah doing over there ?

449
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,700
My father's gonna freak out.

450
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,300
He's gonna be here any minute. Why didn't Jesus put the mezuzah up ?

451
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,400
Oh, Jesús was very upset that you were talking about my breasts

452
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,000
and wanting to buy a bra for me,

453
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
so he said, "Mr. David can go fuck himself".

454
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,100
That's what Jesús said ?

455
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Yeah, he was mad.

456
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
My father's pulling up ! Where's a hammer ?

457
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
He keeps it in the drawer somewhere.

458
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,800
What about a nail ? Where's a nail ?

459
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
I don't know where he keeps the nails !

460
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
what's going on there ?

461
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,300
I'm putting up a mezuzah.

462
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,700
Wait a minute.

463
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
Is that my nail ?

464
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,700
- I'll get you another one.
- You took my nail ?

465
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,000
- Larry !
- That's blasphemy !

466
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,600
What ? What is going on ?

467
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,900
He took my nail ! He took my nail !

468
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,500
He took the nail right off my neck !

469
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,400
- Why'd you have a nail around your neck ?
- That's Jesus' nail !

470
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,900
- That's Jesus' nail !
- No, I know but my father's coming right now !

471
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,400
Hey, boychick.

472
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,800
All right.

473
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,000
All right, kiddo.

474
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Hi, Nat.

475
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,700
This is the best chicken salad I've ever had.

476
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,200
- Ever, right ?
- Unbelievable.

477
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,800
- It's amazing !
- Unbelievable.

478
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,100
I don't know what the hell she does.

479
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,400
My god, she makes chicken salad, she wears brassieres, she does it all !

480
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,800
Yeah, she's very happy with the bras, by the way.

481
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,300
- Really ?
- Yeah. Nailed,

482
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,500
nailed the bra size.

483
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,500
- Really ? 
- I don't know how I do it.

484
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
I've really got some kind of talent for that, you know ?

485
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,600
Maybe you can get a job in a carnival somewhere.

486
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,100
Yeah, it's true.

487
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,100
- I'm good at it.
- Yeah, have your own little booth.

488
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,300
"Step right up. You are...

489
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,700
...36c !"

490
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
- I know.
- Great.

491
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,200
Of course, Jesús freaked out about the whole thing.

492
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,300
- Really ?
- He quit, yeah.

493
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,900
- He quit ?
- Quit.

494
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,600
- Wow.
- The whole thing about the bra,

495
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,300
talking about the bra,

496
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,700
asking her to buy a bra.

497
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,000
He told her to tell me to go fuck myself.

498
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,300
- Really ?
- Yeah.

499
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,700
He's a fucking nut job, this guy.

500
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,400
So, did you replace the nail ?

501
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,300
Did I replace the nail ?

502
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,300
- I believe I have.
- Oh, okay, good.

503
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,700
Your father-in-law's gonna be very happy.

504
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,400
Happy man.

505
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,700
Your dad's happy, you father-in-law's happy,

506
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,100
Unless, of course, any other emergencies arise that require a nail to remedy it.

507
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,500
You never know when you're gonna need a nail.

508
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
- You never know.
- Never know.

509
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,000
- Fuck !
- What's the matter ?

510
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,300
My tooth !

511
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,200
What ?

512
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,800
Fuck !

513
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
I think my tooth fell out.

514
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Shit ! My tooth fell out !

515
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,800
- My tooth !
- From a chicken salad sandwich ?

516
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,800
What fuckin' idiot put bones in a sandwich ?

517
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,900
I bit into a bone !

518
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,100
There's bones in the chicken salad !

519
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,200
Shit !

520
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,400
Fuck !

521
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,900
Quiet.

522
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,000
What's that noise ?

523
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
- What ?
- Shh.

524
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,900
Sounds like your shoes.

525
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,400
Jesús !

526
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,600
I didn't see anybody.

527
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Oh fuck !

528
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,300
- What happened ?
- He just fell.

529
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,300
Fell ?

530
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,000
What is that language ?

531
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,500
I have no idea.

532
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
What's this ?

533
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,900
There's something in his foot !

534
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
Oh my god !

535
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
The nail.

536
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,500
I must have dropped it !

537
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,100
It saved me !

538
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Come on, let's get him some help.
