1
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:17,083
What does it take to be
a "Girls Gone Wild" girl?

2
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,517
You have to show your...!

3
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,089
Those girls
from Cancun are wild.

4
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,963
Yes, they are,
but if you want

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,594
to see how wild they really get,
you've gotta get the video.

6
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,198
- Hello?
- Hey.

7
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,709
- Hey.
- Channel 57.

8
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:47,042
- Yeah, I'm watching.
- Oh ho ho ho!

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,743
- What's going on in the world?
- They're college girls. They're wild.

10
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,252
- They've gone wild.
- We've gotta have it.

11
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:56,847
- Okay.
- I can't have it sent to my house.

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,257
- Susie'll kill me.
- I don't want it sent here.

13
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,887
- How about your office?
- Okay, good, my office.

14
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,521
Okay, I'll order it
on the phone.

15
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,361
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

16
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,629
"...Ultimate Spring Break"
absolutely free.

17
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,262
- You won't believe the insanity...
- Larry?

18
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,431
Oh, have you seen
my Palm Pilot?

19
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,944
Palm Pilot?
It's not here, no.

20
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,104
What are you watching?

21
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:21,670
Just flipping around.

22
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,512
Um, what are we doing about
the poison oak in the backyard?

23
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,247
I thought you were supposed
to be taking care of that.

24
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,347
Jeff's got this Indian guy.
They're immune to it.

25
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,221
- Wandering Bear, yeah.
- Okay.

26
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,556
Um, I'm gonna
see Jeff tomorrow.

27
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,687
- I'll mention it to him.
- Okay.

28
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,720
I'll take care
of it, okay.

29
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:43,498
And, um, while we're here,
have you noticed that we have

30
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,699
not had sex
in a very long time?

31
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,730
I'm watching
this thing about hippos.

32
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,073
This is the longest we've gone since
we've been married.

33
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,045
- I had the dog bite.
- I know. That was awhile ago.

34
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,104
It's better,
isn't it?

35
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,844
You went off the pill.
What are we supposed to do?

36
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,318
So we use condoms
or something.

37
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,150
I can't use condoms.
First of all,

38
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,588
I'm embarrassed to buy 'em,
and I'm not good at it.

39
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,353
Why don't
we do this?

40
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,293
I'll call and make an appointment
for you to have a vasectomy

41
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,923
and then we don't have to worry
about this any longer.

42
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,365
- Okay, fine.
- No no, but I want you to think about...

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,664
I'll get the condoms.
I'll get the condoms.

44
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,898
- Okay.
- Okay.

45
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,633
So have you seen
my Palm Pilot?

46
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,540
It's not here. It's downstairs.
I think it's downstairs.

47
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,807
...see and hear underwater
and they're well insulated.

48
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,679
Don't miss the videos
everyone's talking about.

49
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,946
"Girls Gone Wild
Ultimate Spring Break"

50
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,782
on video or DVD
for just $9.99.

51
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,880
Yes, I was, uh, I was
thinking about ordering

52
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,448
the tape,
the videotape...

53
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:44,395
about the college girls
and the wild, the wildness.

54
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,331
They're going wild
or something.

55
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,494
Somebody told me
about going wild.

56
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,337
Hey.

57
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,348
What's the matter?

58
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,746
Marvin and I broke up.

59
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:10,153
I mean, I can't believe it.
Larry, I can't believe it.

60
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,680
How come?

61
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:15,125
I-I just... I can't say.
It's too personal.

62
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,890
Too personal?

63
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,364
I just don't understand, Larry,
why it happened.

64
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,991
Everything was
going so well.

65
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,002
I thought we were gonna
maybe get married.

66
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,732
I just... I didn't
see this coming at all.

67
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:29,139
I mean how can things be going so well
one day and you're planning a trip,

68
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,939
and then the next day
it's over?

69
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,173
What are those,
Mentos?

70
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,678
Mmm.
Boy, that's really good.

71
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,846
That is a hell
of a candy, you know that?

72
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,186
How do they get the essence
of orange like that?

73
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,625
It's amazing,
just with chemicals.

74
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,290
Well, I got a couple
of things for you to do.

75
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,890
I need you to get
some cash for me.

76
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,130
And I got a corn.
I need some Freeze On.

77
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,365
- I hope that'll get rid of it.
- Mm-hmm.

78
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,533
- One ounce or two?
- Get some Mentos for me.

79
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,944
Fill up my car with mints and gum
and good fresh-breath stuff.

80
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,175
A lot of fresh,
freshness.

81
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,183
So I'll just
reach into the well

82
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,583
and I'll just have an unlimited
good breath supply.

83
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,080
And, uh, cancel lunch with,
uh, Jason Small for me.

84
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,684
Okay, cancel lunch,
and why?

85
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:24,493
I don't know. Tell him it's my mother's
unveiling or something.

86
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:30,392
Okay, so lie and then get
some treats for the car?

87
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,370
Yeah.

88
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,965
Anything else?

89
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,999
Well, your mail
is here.

90
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,270
"Girls Gone Wild,"
Larry?

91
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,111
Hey, what are you doing
opening my mail?

92
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,242
I thought it was my mail.
I ordered a Pilates video.

93
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,014
Look, it says
"Larry David" on it.

94
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,988
Well, I was
a little distracted.

95
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,991
Anyway it's not for me,
it's for Jeff.

96
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,515
- For Jeff?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,027
Come on.
"Girls Gone Wild"?

98
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,326
It's supposed to be
"College Girls Gone Wild."

99
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,889
"College Girls Gone Wild"?
Better... they're younger.

100
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,764
Yeah, "College Girls
Gone Wild."

101
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,827
Do you know what
that does to women?

102
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,101
Terrible, I agree with you.
It's terrible.

103
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,005
Do Jeff a favor
and throw that away.

104
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,873
- I intend to talk to him.
- Good, Larry.

105
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,674
Why the hell does he need
this stuff?

106
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,371
- Hey.
- Hey.

107
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,179
I, uh...

108
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,447
got you
what you need.

109
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,647
Everlast condoms,
my friend.

110
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,418
- Hey.
- The best in the business.

111
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,425
Really?
Oh, thank you.

112
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,825
With those babies
you're never gonna stop.

113
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,024
- Never gonna stop?
- Never gonna stop.

114
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,863
- I want one called "Get It Over With."
- Not Everlast?

115
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,028
How long you think
I'd want to do that for?

116
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,867
All night long,
I would've guessed.

117
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,736
It gets boring,
come on.

118
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,503
- Fucking's boring?
- It doesn't get boring after awhile?

119
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,170
It's a bore.

120
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,042
No, it doesn't get boring.

121
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,742
What is it?
It's enough, in and out.

122
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,649
These things, by the way,
really give me problems anyway.

123
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,051
- I don't know what... can't get them on!
- Just roll them...

124
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,578
Come on,
they fit me.

125
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,112
You gotta get
them on so fast.

126
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,752
- Who's timing you?
- Hmm.

127
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,819
They'll make you
a different kind of man.

128
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,388
So they really make you, like, last?
Everlast?

129
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,297
All night long.

130
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,199
Thank you for getting them for me.

131
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,137
- I'm embarrassed to go to the store.
- My pleasure.

132
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,800
Remember that Indian
you were telling me about?

133
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,174
- Yeah, Wandering Bear.
- I need his number.

134
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,271
I'll be glad to give it to you.
But don't say you got it from me.

135
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,874
He's pissed off at me
'cause Susie doesn't want me

136
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,783
to pay him because he went
$200 over the estimate.

137
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,310
- But it's an estimate.
- It's an estimate!

138
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,381
Hey, what's going on
with your gal down the hall there?

139
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,859
She's crying and...

140
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,328
I'm having a lot
of problems with her.

141
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,058
You know,
first of all...

142
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:43,262
- her boyfriend broke up with her.
- Yeah?

143
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,793
And frankly, I'd like
to do the same.

144
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,999
- Why don't you fire her?
- I can't.

145
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,804
- Why?
- Because she knows everything about me.

146
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,401
She knows
my dietary habits.

147
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,676
She knows about all my web of
lies and bullshit and deceit.

148
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:59,378
- She knows more than Cheryl does.
- You can't fire her.

149
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,512
- She'll destroy me.
- You're trapped.

150
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:05,046
I'm trapped for life. She doesn't want to do
anything else... this is it.

151
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,252
Oh, dear God,
you're trapped!

152
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,955
You know what else
she knows?

153
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,964
She knows about this.

154
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,991
Oh man, it came!
Wow, "College Girls Gone Wild."

155
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,265
Look at that.
We can go to my house and watch it.

156
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,465
Oh, yeah, we'll have
an "Auto Focus" party.

157
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,030
"Auto Focus" party?

158
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,140
I got the big screen,
we can watch it.

159
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,976
Which character
are you gonna be?

160
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,175
- I'm Bob Crane.
- You're Bob Crane?

161
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,808
You can be
the freakish guy.

162
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,376
- I'll be Willem Dafoe.
- He's a freak.

163
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,486
It's the hottest
"Girls Gone Wild" video ever!

164
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,860
I'm having so much trouble
with these glasses.

165
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,365
- I got these blended bifocals.
- Yeah.

166
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,300
And I can't get...
I can't get used to them.

167
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Yeah, aw, here we go.

168
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,700
Right at the top, they're
just doing it right away.

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,200
If a guy did that, he'd get
arrested. You know that?

170
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,000
They'd throw him in jail,
and that would be the end

171
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,000
of him. He'd be a pariah for
the rest of his life.

172
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,000
TV: "Let's see those real
boobies, all right?"

173
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,000
TV (girl): "Oh my god!"

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,900
Do you know what a woman
would do if I ever asked her to

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why do you have to analyze
this? Can't we just watch it?

176
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,000
She would spit on me!

177
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,000
If I ever asked a girl to
lift up her top, she would

178
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,500
kick me in the balls and spit
on me.

179
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,000
We waited a long time to see
this.

180
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,000
Now all you're doing is just
yacking. Be quiet, come on.

181
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,000
You know what? I gotta,
actually --

182
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,300
I can't even see in these
glasses.

183
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,200
Well, sit closer.

184
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,000
These bifocals aren't any
good, I don't think.

185
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,264
I wanna go to the car
and get my other glasses, okay?

186
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,965
- Go ahead.
- Pause it. I'll be back in two seconds.

187
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:39,303
- No, I'm not gonna pause it.
- What do you mean?

188
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:41,536
I'm not a pauser.
I don't like pausing.

189
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:42,400
Well, that's rude. I'll miss
it!

190
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll rewind it when you come
back.

191
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,200
But I can see when you rewind
-- it'll give it away.

192
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,900
There's no story! Give what
away?

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,500
There's bosoms, that's it!

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
Well, why give the bosom
away?

195
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,790
Fine!

196
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:57,029
Hurry up!

197
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:13,587
- Ready?
- Yeah, that's more like it.

198
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,200
Hey, what is that? That's
not where we left off.

199
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,900
That's exactly where we
left off.

200
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,000
I guarantee you that's not
where we left off and you --

201
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,500
know it!

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,560
- Have you seen Oscar?
- No.

203
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:27,070
Oscar?!

204
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:30,097
Did you leave
the door open?

205
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:34,909
- Yeah, when l...
- God damn it.

206
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:37,711
What, I...

207
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:40,179
Oscar!

208
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:41,344
Oscar!

209
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:43,650
Oscar!

210
00:09:43,688 --> 00:09:46,953
- Oscar!
- Oscar!

211
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:50,722
- Oskie!
- Oscar!

212
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:57,835
- See that?
- What?

213
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:00,599
I waved to a guy in a Prius
and he didn't wave back.

214
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:02,697
I don't wave to people
with the same car as me.

215
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,038
We're Prius drivers...
we're a special breed.

216
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:06,941
A special breed.

217
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:09,606
You know what?
I wanna see what's up with that guy.

218
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:12,172
See what's up with that guy?
What are you doing?

219
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:16,312
What are you gonna do
after you catch him?

220
00:10:16,354 --> 00:10:18,754
Nothin'.

221
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,018
Oh my God!

222
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,787
Oscar.

223
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:28,094
Oscar!

224
00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:30,794
Oh my God,
are you okay?

225
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:33,633
- Oskie, are you okay, boy?
- He seems okay.

226
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:35,866
He's not bleeding
or anything.

227
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:38,876
Let me see if he can stand.
Come on, stand up, Oskie.

228
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,037
- Oh, yeah.
- He seems fine.

229
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,274
Aw.

230
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:46,010
What do you want to do?
Should we take him to the vet?

231
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,813
He seems okay.

232
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:50,252
He actually
does seem okay.

233
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:52,586
All right, we'll go
back to the house.

234
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:54,785
We'll put the video in,

235
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:57,852
watch it and the whole time
we'll monitor Oscar.

236
00:10:57,895 --> 00:11:00,591
Yeah, we'll watch
the video,

237
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:03,362
and we'll keep an eye
on him at the same time.

238
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05,869
I'm not saying don't take him
to the vet if he needs to.

239
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:07,871
We'll watch the video
and monitor him.

240
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:10,271
Video and monitor,
that's it.

241
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:14,608
- Let's get him in the car.
- Do not tell anyone about this.

242
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:17,137
Well, he knows about it.
Good thing he can't talk.

243
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:19,149
Come on, pal,
hop in.

244
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:21,151
- He seems okay.
- He seems fine.

245
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:23,881
- Huh, is it my imagination?
- No, he seems fine.

246
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:26,082
- I think he seems okay.
- Yeah.

247
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:28,786
I got news for you.
I don't even think I hit him.

248
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:30,350
I don't think
you hit him, either.

249
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:32,386
- I did not hit that dog.
- You did not hit that dog.

250
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,954
Hey, let's make
a pact right now.

251
00:11:33,998 --> 00:11:35,966
If we notice anything wrong
while watching,

252
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,059
we're gonna stop the tape
and take him to the vet.

253
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:41,071
- Immediately. Let's go.
- Immediately.

254
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:51,343
See, it pays to lay off
that sex for a while.

255
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:56,648
It kind of reminds me of when
Mantle was injured in '63.

256
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:58,952
He was out for
about two months.

257
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,890
Comes back,
first at bat,

258
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:03,826
out of the park,
home run.

259
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:06,728
Huh? It's kind
of similar.

260
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,663
What?

261
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:13,535
There's something really

262
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:17,337
strange happening.

263
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,843
I am completely numb.

264
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:21,276
Yeah.

265
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:23,041
- Down there?
- Yeah.

266
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:25,276
I can't feel anything.

267
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:26,476
- Really?
- Yeah.

268
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:29,577
Hmm.

269
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,418
I don't know why.
This has never happened before.

270
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:36,894
Well, it has something
to do with the condom?

271
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:39,726
I don't know
why it would.

272
00:12:40,898 --> 00:12:42,661
"Everlast...

273
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,691
lasts all night.

274
00:12:44,736 --> 00:12:49,105
Contains
the numbing agent...

275
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,768
lidocaine."

276
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:57,773
What?

277
00:12:57,815 --> 00:13:01,444
I must have put it
on inside out.

278
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:04,319
Inside out? Honestly, you don't
know how to put this on?

279
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:07,791
I just... I didn't... no, I slipped it on the way
you're supposed to put it on.

280
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:09,986
15-year-old boys
do it every day.

281
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:12,791
- It's not hard!
- I don't use it often. I slipped it on.

282
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,798
There's no instructions
or anything.

283
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:17,562
- I rolled it down.
- There's a wrong and a right way.

284
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:20,901
You're the one who wanted
to wear the condom.

285
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:24,271
You didn't tell me you didn't
know how to put it on, Larry. Jesus.

286
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:26,572
I didn't know you could
put it on inside out!

287
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:32,579
- Hello?
- Hey.

288
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:35,313
Hey, that condom
you gave me, Everlast?

289
00:13:35,353 --> 00:13:37,480
- There's something wrong with it.
- What?

290
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:39,114
I put it on inside out
by mistake.

291
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:41,318
Now Cheryl's all numb
in her vagina.

292
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:43,156
Don't you know how
to put a rubber on?

293
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:46,652
It's dark... who can read?
I can't start reading instructions.

294
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:48,062
How could you
have done that?

295
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:50,761
I knew there was something
uncomfortable about it.

296
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:53,532
It was really like squeezing
the life out of me.

297
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,402
They're designed
to go the other way.

298
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,067
Then you last
and you last.

299
00:13:57,108 --> 00:13:59,440
- Have you ever heard of this before?
- What?

300
00:13:59,477 --> 00:14:02,605
- The numb vagina?
- We got bigger problems.

301
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:05,207
- What?
- Oscar is not good.

302
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:07,513
He's just lethargic
as can be

303
00:14:07,552 --> 00:14:10,988
and his bark
is like...

304
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:13,889
- emasculated.
- You think it's from the incident?

305
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:17,383
- Yes, I think it has.
- Jeffrey!

306
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:20,659
- Susie knows something's going down.
- Where are you?

307
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:23,223
You listen and you listen good.
You keep that trap shut.

308
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:25,929
What did you do to this dog?!
Something's wrong with Oscar!

309
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,938
Susie's yelling.
I gotta get going.

310
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:30,065
I'm sorry about
Cheryl's vagina.

311
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:32,575
- What's wrong with him?
- I'll talk to you later, bye.

312
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:40,214
Hey!

313
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:43,152
How is it?

314
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:46,679
It feels like it's been
shot with novocaine.

315
00:14:46,724 --> 00:14:48,157
- Oh my God.
- There's nothing.

316
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:51,184
I'm really sorry.

317
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,457
Hi, Wandering Bear.

318
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:58,901
How's it going?

319
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:00,494
Good.

320
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:02,802
Okay.

321
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,276
Hey, I'm sorry about that situation
with Jeff and Susie.

322
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:10,445
You should just go there
and demand that they pay you

323
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:13,177
the money they owe you.
I guarantee you'll get it.

324
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,721
There's an old
Indian saying,

325
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:20,587
"What goes around
comes around."

326
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,957
You sure that's Indian?

327
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:25,121
I thought
that was English.

328
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:27,062
It could apply
to anyone.

329
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:31,057
Hey, Wandering Bear,
let me ask you a question.

330
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:35,129
You're a shaman
of sorts.

331
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:38,073
You know all about
plants and herbs

332
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:40,669
and you're kind of
a medicine man in a way.

333
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:43,305
Last night...

334
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:47,181
I put a condom on
inside out.

335
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:50,187
And my wife's vagina
is completely numb.

336
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:52,689
Do you know of any...

337
00:15:52,723 --> 00:15:56,625
herbal remedy that
might work for her?

338
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:07,266
Hmm...

339
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:10,069
give me a pencil
and paper.

340
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:12,769
Well, I have a pen.

341
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,938
Same thing.

342
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,709
Well...

343
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:19,443
yeah, but you said pencil,

344
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:21,917
so I just thought I'd
mention that I had a pen.

345
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:26,982
They both perform
the same function.

346
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:29,993
That's true.
Pencil has an eraser.

347
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,552
You make a mistake,
you can erase.

348
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:36,033
So there's a slight difference.
Some people are very specific about it.

349
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:41,562
- One writes, the other writes.
- But you did say pencil.

350
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:03,889
Is that a "Y"?

351
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:08,092
That's a "T."

352
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:10,760
Thank you,
Wandering Bear.

353
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:20,368
What?

354
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:36,522
- Hey.
- Hey.

355
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,791
You forgot to cancel
that lunch with Jason Small.

356
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,230
Oh!
Oh, yeah.

357
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:44,393
He called my house.
It was kind of embarrassing.

358
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:45,697
Really? Wow.

359
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:49,263
Oh, gosh, I'm really
sorry about that.

360
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:52,207
Um, today I need you
to go to Mel Brooks's office

361
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:54,336
and pick up some
music for me.

362
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:56,642
Then I need you to go
to my business manager's office,

363
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:59,115
there's a package which I
need you to bring to my house.

364
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,109
Uh, hey, let me ask you,
um, like a guy question.

365
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:04,815
Sure.

366
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:07,585
At home my machine
is full of all these hang-ups.

367
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,058
Yeah?

368
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:12,221
I'm wondering if it's Marvin
because he wants to talk to me.

369
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:14,629
- Of course. Yes yes.
- Is it?

370
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:17,190
So I don't know what to do.

371
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:19,998
I mean clearly he's
reaching out,

372
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:22,767
but I shouldn't make
the first move, right?

373
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:26,800
Yeah, you want
to get the phone?

374
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:28,402
Should I make
the first...

375
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:30,175
- No.
- I should stand my ground.

376
00:18:30,214 --> 00:18:31,374
Mmm-hmm.

377
00:18:31,415 --> 00:18:33,315
Okay, thanks, Larry.

378
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,818
Hello? Larry David's...
hello?

379
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:44,318
Wandering Bear
cured her vagina.

380
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:46,955
He wrote down this thing...
it's a root or something.

381
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:48,828
She went to
a health food store.

382
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:51,926
I spoke to her on the phone...
she's better.

383
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:54,369
Wandering Bear
cures vaginas?

384
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:56,566
That guy is some kind
of magician or something.

385
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:59,007
I wish I had special powers
over the vagina.

386
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:00,738
How's, uh, how's Oscar,
by the way?

387
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:02,109
Not good.

388
00:19:02,146 --> 00:19:05,115
He's, uh, just moping around,
same old thing,

389
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:06,673
making those noises.

390
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:07,911
Susie took him
to the vet.

391
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:10,113
Did you say
anything?

392
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:13,420
Okay?

393
00:19:13,457 --> 00:19:16,551
Oh, hey, by the way, here,
you can have these condoms back.

394
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:19,119
No, I'm not
using them anymore.

395
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:20,460
My doctor
told me not to.

396
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:23,058
He says it's no good for me
to keep going and going.

397
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,863
It's not good
for my heart.

398
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:26,733
Wow.

399
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:28,295
It's a rubber
for a young man.

400
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,864
You know what?
You might be right about that.

401
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:32,739
Okay, that's who
it's for.

402
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:35,610
Hey, my 5-wood's coming in today
at 4:30. Let's go get it.

403
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:38,615
- All right, I'll pick you up at 4:30.
- Beautiful.

404
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:49,083
Hey.

405
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:51,856
- Hi.
- Hi.

406
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:53,659
What did the vet say?

407
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:56,564
He said that Oscar's voice box
is damaged as though somebody

408
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,468
- was trying to strangle him.
- Strangle the dog?

409
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:03,735
Ssomebody was trying to choke him.
Who could that be, I wonder?

410
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:07,005
What, who would want to do
something like that?

411
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:08,875
The dog bit your penis
so you're trying

412
00:20:08,913 --> 00:20:10,744
to fucking kill him?
Is that what it is?

413
00:20:10,781 --> 00:20:13,682
- No, that's ridiculous!
- Really? Then what happened?

414
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:15,617
How come he can't speak?
What's wrong with him?

415
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:17,245
I don't know, maybe
he got hit by a car.

416
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:19,449
Oh, please, he's gonna
get hit by a car, how?

417
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,924
Well, maybe somebody
left the door open.

418
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,427
Who's gonna leave the door open
and let him out?

419
00:20:24,461 --> 00:20:25,985
Jeff could have.

420
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,362
Jeff, did you
leave the door open?

421
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:31,300
- Yeah, exactly.
- I'm not saying he did it on purpose.

422
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:33,428
Maybe he went to get
something from his car.

423
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,267
Maybe you didn't try
to strangle him,

424
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:38,070
but something else happened,
and you were involved,

425
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:41,339
and I am gonna get
to the bottom of this.

426
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:52,253
Hi, Wandering Bear.

427
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:54,120
Hello.

428
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:56,149
How is your vagina?

429
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:01,593
It's...

430
00:21:01,632 --> 00:21:03,327
getting better.

431
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,358
Good.

432
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,480
Wandering Bear just asked me
how my vagina is.

433
00:21:20,517 --> 00:21:23,816
Well, I'm sure he just wanted
to see if his cure was working.

434
00:21:23,854 --> 00:21:25,845
I don't appreciate
strangers

435
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,120
asking me about
my vagina. God.

436
00:21:28,158 --> 00:21:32,356
- Wait a second. Did you thank him?
- No.

437
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:35,160
You could have at least
expressed some gratitude.

438
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:37,133
He did cure your vagina,
did he not?

439
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,404
Hey, Wandering Bear...

440
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:49,706
might not be
such a good idea

441
00:21:49,747 --> 00:21:52,682
to ask my wife
how her vagina is.

442
00:21:52,716 --> 00:21:55,276
I don't know how it is
with American Indians,

443
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,153
but the Jew generally doesn't ask
other men's wives about their vagina.

444
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:02,625
It's a custom thing.

445
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,720
Well, if you take her
to the white man doctor,

446
00:22:05,763 --> 00:22:09,028
he will not only ask
about her vagina,

447
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,931
he'll look.

448
00:22:10,968 --> 00:22:14,028
Good point, Wandering Bear,
good point.

449
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:16,039
Anyway, it's really
working out.

450
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:19,065
She's feeling a lot better.
Thanks again.

451
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:28,045
Hey.
Here are the papers

452
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:30,883
from your business
manager's office.

453
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:33,185
So...

454
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:35,783
What about the music
from Mel's office?

455
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:39,193
Oh, Larry, was I supposed
to pick that up?

456
00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:41,254
Yeah.

457
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:43,266
I'm sorry.
I totally forgot.

458
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,894
Uh-huh, just like you
forgot to call Jason Small

459
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:48,666
and cancel
the lunch appointment.

460
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:51,539
Okay, fine,
I'm sorry.

461
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:53,634
I'm terrible.
I'm a bad assistant.

462
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:55,406
You know,
I don't need this.

463
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:57,414
Do your own errands,
run your own life.

464
00:22:57,448 --> 00:22:59,939
- I'm done. No, I quit, Larry.
- What are you talking about?

465
00:22:59,984 --> 00:23:01,952
- What?
- I don't need this anymore.

466
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:05,285
- No, you can't quit.
- Tell Jason Small, or maybe I will,

467
00:23:05,322 --> 00:23:06,983
about your mom's
fake unveiling.

468
00:23:07,024 --> 00:23:08,753
How about that?
Isn't that nice?

469
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,692
And I'm sure Cheryl
would love to hear

470
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:13,094
about "College Girls
Gone Wild."

471
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,430
Yeah, Cheryl, that's right. "College Girls
Gone Wild," Cheryl, it's hot!

472
00:23:17,468 --> 00:23:20,369
You know what? Everybody's gonna know
every lie, every deceit,

473
00:23:20,404 --> 00:23:22,838
every half-truth
you have ever told, mister!

474
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:24,306
Eight years
of service!

475
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:27,139
Come on, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

476
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:29,042
I'm sorry.
I apologize.

477
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,376
But you can't quit.

478
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:32,746
Come on, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry!

479
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:34,751
Larry?

480
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:37,151
What are you doing?
What's going on?

481
00:23:37,187 --> 00:23:39,951
She quit. She quit.
She's gonna expose me to the world.

482
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,323
She said she's gonna tell
everybody about my lies and my deceit.

483
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,794
And I said terrible things
about so many people.

484
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:49,196
And you and Jeff and Susie and Louis,
everybody I know and...

485
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:51,224
What have you
said about me?

486
00:23:51,268 --> 00:23:52,963
- Oh, did I say you?
- Yeah.

487
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:54,971
No no, I didn't mean you.
No, the others.

488
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:56,438
The others, not you.

489
00:23:56,473 --> 00:23:59,237
But the point is that I'm gonna
be ruined, you understand?

490
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:02,712
- We're gonna have to move.
- Why was she so upset?

491
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:05,340
I yelled at her. She was supposed
to do some stuff for me.

492
00:24:05,382 --> 00:24:08,078
- She didn't do it.
- I'm sure she'll be fine once she...

493
00:24:08,118 --> 00:24:11,019
She hasn't been fine since she
broke up with her boyfriend.

494
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:13,489
That's the whole problem.

495
00:24:13,524 --> 00:24:16,721
See, now if I could get
those two back together...

496
00:24:18,862 --> 00:24:22,161
I need to talk to her boyfriend.
I got news for you.

497
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,996
Okay.

498
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:26,662
That's what I need to do.

499
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,148
- Hey, Marv.
- Hi, Larry.

500
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,451
- I came to see you.
- Okay, yeah, sit down.

501
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,050
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

502
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:52,893
So, uh, I wanted to talk
to you about Antoinette.

503
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,922
Oh, uh, yeah,
that's, um...

504
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:59,402
that's a tough, uh,
a tough situation.

505
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:01,165
I don't understand
what happened.

506
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:02,900
You were such
a great couple and...

507
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,908
Yeah, you know,
she's a great gal.

508
00:25:04,942 --> 00:25:06,671
She really is.
I love her...

509
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,473
What are you
breaking up with her for?

510
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:11,481
You know, it's personal.

511
00:25:11,515 --> 00:25:14,109
I know.
That's what she said.

512
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:16,415
It's, uh...

513
00:25:16,453 --> 00:25:17,977
Pour it out, buddy.

514
00:25:19,623 --> 00:25:21,955
It's sexual, sexual.

515
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:25,359
Marvin, I've had every sexual problem
known to mankind.

516
00:25:25,395 --> 00:25:27,090
What is it,
you're impotent?

517
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:29,656
I've gone 10 years with no erection.
What is that?

518
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,099
That's not it.
It's not that.

519
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:36,602
When the race begins,

520
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,165
I'm at the finish line
just like that...

521
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:41,677
Quick quick,
I finish quick.

522
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:44,237
Ah...

523
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:46,010
Hmm.

524
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:48,244
It's tough.

525
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:49,616
Hmm.

526
00:25:58,428 --> 00:26:00,419
- Marv.
- Yes?

527
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:06,231
Your problems
are over.

528
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,068
Everlast condom?

529
00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:11,700
I've used condoms before,
Larry, they don't help.

530
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:14,370
You haven't
used this one.

531
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:16,971
All night, my friend...

532
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:20,245
all night.

533
00:26:24,388 --> 00:26:26,822
I've just got one little
word of advice for you.

534
00:26:26,857 --> 00:26:29,291
Don't wear it
inside out.

535
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:32,358
Thanks, Larry.

536
00:26:45,242 --> 00:26:47,210
- Hey.
- Ready to go?

537
00:26:47,244 --> 00:26:50,077
Yeah, let me go get my jacket.
I'll be right out.

538
00:26:50,113 --> 00:26:52,513
How's Oscar?

539
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:54,016
He's not good, Larry.

540
00:26:54,051 --> 00:26:55,780
He's not good.
He's the same.

541
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:58,754
He hasn't gotten any better.
I know you did something.

542
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:02,055
I'll get that.

543
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:03,923
Yeah, good,
go get the door.

544
00:27:03,961 --> 00:27:06,486
Ah, Wandering Bear.

545
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,498
- No, I don't want him in the house.
- Come in.

546
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:10,625
- Hello, David.
- Hello.

547
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:14,398
I've come
to collect my money.

548
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:17,839
Wandering Elk, whatever the fuck
your name is, you were paid already.

549
00:27:17,874 --> 00:27:19,535
You don't need
to talk like that.

550
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:22,409
- You're a better person than that.
- No, she's not.

551
00:27:22,446 --> 00:27:25,210
We paid you, that was it.
I'd like you out of my house.

552
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:28,707
- I need to be paid in full please.
- You don't get out of my house,

553
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:30,617
- I'll get my dog.
- Susie!

554
00:27:30,654 --> 00:27:32,349
- Oscar!
- Susie, come on.

555
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,550
- Oscar!
- Please don't do that.

556
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:40,625
You see this?
He's useless.

557
00:27:40,664 --> 00:27:42,359
You see what you did to him?
He's useless.

558
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,094
This used to be a watchdog.

559
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,662
May I take a look at him?

560
00:27:49,906 --> 00:27:52,807
Fine fine,
go ahead.

561
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:37,880
Ahhh!

562
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:48,693
Hey, Prius!
