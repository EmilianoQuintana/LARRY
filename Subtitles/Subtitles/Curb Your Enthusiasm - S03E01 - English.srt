1
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:18,895
So, I've given up red meat.

2
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:20,422
Really?

3
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:22,492
- Yep, no more red meat for me.
- Good for you.

4
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:24,834
- That's it, I'm done.
- How come you're doing that?

5
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:27,271
- No reason.
- What do you mean?

6
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:29,138
- You got to have a reason.
- No reason.

7
00:00:29,176 --> 00:00:31,110
- What do you care?
- Hey, schmuckface,

8
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:33,271
you can't just say
you're giving up red meat.

9
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:35,247
There has to be some
motivation behind it.

10
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:37,250
No reason.

11
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:42,121
Gonna invest in the restaurant?
Gonna come to the meeting tomorrow?

12
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:44,419
- I don't know, I'm thinking about it.
- All right.

13
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,120
- Ted Danson's doing it.
- Really?

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,025
- Yeah. Michael York.
- Is that so?

15
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:50,689
Yeah, a couple other people.

16
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:53,222
Got the manager and the assistant
manager from Gus'.

17
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:55,461
- You think it's a good investment?
- A great investment.

18
00:00:55,502 --> 00:00:57,970
- It's great fun.
- It could be fun, couldn't it?

19
00:00:58,004 --> 00:00:59,835
Great fun, come on.

20
00:00:59,873 --> 00:01:02,740
I'll bet that's true.
I'll bet that's true.

21
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:06,439
Yeah... you know?

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,971
Hey! Hey, buddy,
what's the deal?

23
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:10,846
- What are you talking about?

24
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:13,284
You threw something
in my garbage can?

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,687
- I threw garbage in your garbage can.
- That's my garbage can.

26
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:20,022
- So, it's garbage.
- I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't.

27
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,585
Doesn't garbage belong
in a garbage can?

28
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:24,961
My garbage belongs
in my garbage can.

29
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:27,125
Your garbage belongs
in your garbage can.

30
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:29,533
- Well, what's the difference?
- The difference?

31
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:31,730
- It's mine.
- The can's not full. I don't get it.

32
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:34,639
Next guy I see throwing
garbage in there,

33
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:36,073
I'm gonna kick his ass.

34
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:38,634
I'll give that message
to the next guy.

35
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:40,737
- You think I'm kidding?
- No, I believe you.

36
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:44,239
- I'm gonna tell the next guy.
- Yeah, you do that.

37
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:51,488
- Hi, Barbara.
- Hi, nice to see you.

38
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:53,152
Hi. How you doing?

39
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:55,252
- Hi!
- Ready to go?

40
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:57,092
Yeah.

41
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,257
Lar, do you want
some, um, coffee?

42
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:02,894
- Oh, no, no, we're gonna get going.
- Okay.

43
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:07,430
- How's everything going?
- Well, you know, horrible.

44
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:09,135
Horrible, yeah.

45
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:11,041
I'm gonna get the catalogs.

46
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:13,409
- And I'll be right back.
- Great, thank you.

47
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:15,244
How's everything?

48
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:19,651
Good. I mean, she's talked
about Chet the whole time.

49
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:23,679
- You ask her about the picture frame?
- No. How can I?

50
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:25,714
She's been like that
all afternoon.

51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,961
I mean, I don't know
what to do about this thing.

52
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:32,590
You gave her this picture
five months ago.

53
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:35,897
- All she's got to do is get a frame.
- All right, I'll ask her.

54
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:38,461
- Her husband's been dead
for four months now.

55
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:41,099
I'll bring it up before we go.

56
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:43,473
Okay, I think
these are the ones.

57
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,808
- Great. Oh, thank you.
- Right?

58
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:48,007
- Exactly.
- Isn't that nice?

59
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:50,016
Yeah, that's exactly...

60
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,881
To show you
something different.

61
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:55,183
- Boy, I love this shirt.
- Isn't that a great picture?

62
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:58,487
That is exactly the kind of shirt
that I would wear. Don't you think?

63
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:01,824
- Mm-hmm.
- That's great.

64
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:04,660
- Did you take that here?
- It was in the back yard.

65
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:08,190
- Doesn't he look healthy, Larry?
- Do you know where he got this?

66
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:11,534
- I don't remember.
- No idea?

67
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:15,539
I just... I don't remember.

68
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:18,043
- I love that picture.
- It's nice.

69
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:21,673
Could it have been...
the mall or the Promenade?

70
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:25,116
No, but I'll...

71
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,813
Think about it.

72
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,658
So, you... okay.

73
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:35,923
Thank you for lunch.
That was really great.

74
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,797
- Was it in Santa Monica?
- I don't know.

75
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:43,667
You don't know.
Okay, all right.

76
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:45,432
It's just it's such
a great-looking shirt.

77
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:48,236
It's Caruso's.
Yeah, it was Caruso's.

78
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:51,210
On Wilshire Boulevard!
Yes, of course!

79
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:54,213
- Caruso's. Great.
- That's a nice picture.

80
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:57,239
- I love it.
- All right, well, we're gonna take off.

81
00:03:57,284 --> 00:04:00,515
I'm gonna stop off
at Caruso's and get that shirt.

82
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:03,614
I wonder if it comes
in any other colors.

83
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:08,526
And just wanted to check in
about the frame...

84
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:11,429
- the picture that you were gonna frame.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:13,329
How's that going?

86
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,924
I don't know.

87
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:17,436
'Cause it's kind of been
like five months, you know?

88
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,667
And we were just wondering.

89
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:22,834
My husband dropped dead.

90
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:25,970
- Yeah, that was four months ago.
- Okay.

91
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:29,106
You know, there was
just some details...

92
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:32,482
- that I had to take care of, right?
- You know what...

93
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,080
God forbid it should
ever happen to you, Cheryl.

94
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,283
I don't think you would be
thinking about...

95
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:41,351
She'd be dancing around
the Trevi Fountain in Rome...

96
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:43,794
- that's just a joke.
- I'm sorry.

97
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,824
I'm just not ready to have a sense
of humor about this, you know?

98
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,735
- I understand.
- I'm sorry. You take care.

99
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,763
- Thanks for the lunch and the catalogs.
- Yeah.

100
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:00,903
- What's the name of this place anyway?
- Bobo's.

101
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:03,677
Bobo's? I like that.

102
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:10,590
- Ted.
- Jeff, hey.

103
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:12,888
Are you in on this too?
Are you in on this too?

104
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:14,985
What are you doing,
throwing your money away?

105
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:16,495
- Why not?
- Really?

106
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:18,497
You ever done
anything like this?

107
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:22,627
I once invested
in a whorehouse.

108
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:25,900
- I made a fortune on that place.
- How are you?

109
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,736
I'm great, man, I'm great.

110
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:29,935
- How's Mary doing?
- She's good.

111
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:32,843
She's in Australia
shooting that film still.

112
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,109
Which is too bad,
because she's going crazy.

113
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,116
She's missing
Jill's birthday...

114
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,243
which reminds me,
a week from Sunday,

115
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:41,048
- the birthday party for Jill.
- I'm all over it.

116
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:42,714
- You're coming?
- All set.

117
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:45,520
Here's the embarrassing part:
we promised her a "Wizard of Oz"

118
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:49,016
kind of party thing.
So, I'm going to do the Scarecrow.

119
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:51,053
If I got you
the costume, would you do,

120
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:54,589
- I don't know, one of them, the Lion?
- Lion? Sure.

121
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:57,728
Him? I do an unbelievable Lion.

122
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:00,103
Well, I got to do
the Lion, though, seriously.

123
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,439
Let me do the Lion.
You will not regret it.

124
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:05,444
- A fat Tin Man?
- I can't do...

125
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,446
I won't come
if I have to do the Tin Man.

126
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,176
- Let him do it.
- You can be the Lion.

127
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:12,548
I'll be the fat Tin Man
that'll disappoint children.

128
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:14,917
- What are you gonna do for Dorothy?
- What about Cheryl?

129
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:17,286
- Would she come?
- Cheryl could do Dorothy.

130
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:19,416
- She would love to.
- Great. Thank you.

131
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:22,860
I'll get the costumes
and everything... this is really nice.

132
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:25,296
- You like this?
- Great taste. Where'd you get it?

133
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,528
I got it... actually
I saw a dead guy's picture.

134
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:30,934
Everybody, Larry David.

135
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,097
Hey, Michael York,
how you doing?

136
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,199
- Glad to meet you.
- Michael's here to class up our act.

137
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:38,301
- Lou DiMaggio.
- How are you doing?

138
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:39,641
Nice to meet you, Larry.

139
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,306
Pleasure to meet you.

140
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,645
I'll be managing
the restaurant. Jim Swenson.

141
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:46,277
- Hi, Jim. You were the manager of Gus'.
- Yes, I was.

142
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,310
- Theresa Nakamura.
- Hello. Hi, Theresa.

143
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:49,878
I was at Gus', too.

144
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:51,914
Let's sit, let's sit.

145
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:57,153
I don't know
if I'm gonna come in on this.

146
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:59,358
It sounds intriguing,
I have to say.

147
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,266
We have a very
exciting place here.

148
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:06,500
The location is perfect. And we got
great ideas for a new restaurant.

149
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,200
It's going to be a hit.

150
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,868
Well, I know one thing,

151
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:13,401
I will not be giving you people
any money if you serve kabobs.

152
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:17,607
- You're kidding, right?
- No, I'm not kidding.

153
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,244
- I don't think have kabobs.
- Why are you a kabobaphobe?

154
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:22,186
- I can't stand kabobs.
- "Kabobaphobe"?

155
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:25,385
Have you had a bad experience
with kabobs? What happened?

156
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:27,757
Just when you're putting
them off the stick...

157
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:30,058
I'm a little afraid
of the stick, frankly.

158
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:33,964
No kabobs!

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,763
How about this idea?

160
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:39,704
I feel that you can
never get a waiter's attention.

161
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:42,765
So, I'm suggesting

162
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:45,209
that every table
should have a bell on it.

163
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:49,474
And so, when you want
the waiter, you just ring a bell...

164
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:52,076
What if three or four people
are ringing the thing at once?

165
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:53,483
How does their waiter know...

166
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,351
Every waiter could have
their own tone.

167
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:58,152
So you can identify... when the waiter
hears "ding, ding, ding,"

168
00:07:58,191 --> 00:07:59,715
they know it's him.

169
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,353
And if then if it's
"ding, ding, ding," a lower tone...

170
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:04,386
- A bell?
- They would answer to a bell

171
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,091
like a Pavlovian dog?

172
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:07,827
- It's like a butler bell.
- Exactly!

173
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,732
I'm surprised
you're not on board with that.

174
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,930
It's English.
It's a butler bell.

175
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:15,668
- Michael York, what do you think?
- I'm so appalled by the idea

176
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,905
- that I'm struck dumb.
- It's a good idea. Think about it.

177
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:21,072
What else do you have?

178
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:23,378
What are you doing
for the waiters' uniforms?

179
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,283
We have a very tasteful
white shirt, dark slacks,

180
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,253
and name tags.

181
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:31,314
- No good, huh?
- I think we can do better than that.

182
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:34,952
- Larry, what do you envision?
- I don't know, I think...

183
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:36,928
I'll go shopping for uniforms.

184
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:39,761
- You'll come with me.
- I'm with you to keep an eye on things.

185
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,494
All right,
so give us a choice.

186
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:44,059
I'll come back with something
you'll be very happy with.

187
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,833
Is everybody good with that?
I'm good with that.

188
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:48,807
So, you're in.

189
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:50,867
Welcome aboard.

190
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,174
Maybe.

191
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,953
So, we're definitely
doing this?

192
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:04,252
It's right on Ocean. It's in a great
location, they've got a great chef...

193
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,121
They couldn't find somebody
else to invest?

194
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,683
There are tons
of people with money.

195
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:10,161
Maybe they could,
but I'm lucky I was asked.

196
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:12,164
We should look at it
like a good thing.

197
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:14,166
- We can make a lot of money from this.
- Oh, I hope so.

198
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,566
- But that's not even the point.
- What is the point?

199
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:18,696
We could hang out there.

200
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:22,071
People would come in and I'll walk
around and go to a table...

201
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:24,975
- "Are you enjoying your meal?"
- You're going to walk around?

202
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:27,445
This is why you want to do this,
so you can chat with people?

203
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,607
"How's everything?
Are you enjoying it?"

204
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:31,583
I thought you didn't
like talking to people.

205
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:34,018
I don't like talking
to people I know,

206
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:36,817
but strangers
I have no problem with.

207
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:39,689
I think it'll be fun.
I was put in charge of uniforms.

208
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:42,752
This is something that
I'm very interested in.

209
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:44,956
I always wondered,
"How do they choose the uniforms?"

210
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:46,966
Well, I'm going
to choose the uniforms.

211
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,935
I'm going shopping with Jeff
to pick out uniforms for the waiters.

212
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,732
That's why you want
to do this...

213
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:54,171
so you can
pick out uniforms for...

214
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:57,040
It's not only uniforms,
you're making other decisions.

215
00:09:57,076 --> 00:10:00,637
I asked about... we're gonna
get sweet potatoes on the menu.

216
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:05,341
'Cause you can't get sweet potatoes
anywhere. Have you noticed that?

217
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:07,182
Everybody's noticed that.

218
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,085
I have this great idea about
bells for the table,

219
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:10,851
'cause you can
never summon waiters.

220
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,517
They never come
when you want them.

221
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:15,026
Did you bring this up at the meeting?
How did that go over?

222
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:17,529
- I think it went okay.
- They liked that idea?

223
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:19,463
- I think they did.
- People ringing bells

224
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:21,729
- all over the restaurant?
- Yeah.

225
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:23,861
Is that a new shirt?

226
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:25,928
Yeah, this is the shirt

227
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:29,738
- that Chet was wearing in the picture.
- At Barbara's house?

228
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:32,540
I went to Caruso's and got it.
They had three left.

229
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:35,706
Really?
You went shopping?

230
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:38,842
I did. I love the shirt.
Ted Danson liked it too.

231
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:41,012
I'm getting a lot
of compliments on it.

232
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:43,887
- It looks good.
- Feel this material. This is beautiful.

233
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:47,552
So, Barbara said she'd have
that frame ready next week.

234
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,288
- Oh, good, see?
- See?

235
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:52,059
It paid for me
to open my mouth.

236
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:54,430
And your dentist called and wants
us over for dinner Saturday.

237
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:57,863
- Dr. Blore?
- Yeah.

238
00:10:57,904 --> 00:11:00,668
- Wants to have us for dinner?
- Yeah.

239
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:04,268
I thought that you'd
know what that meant.

240
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,778
He's my dentist.
Why is he calling me for dinner?

241
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:09,577
I don't know.

242
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:13,176
Well, what are we gonna
talk about, my teeth?

243
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:15,779
I didn't know what to say.
I thought you guys talked about it.

244
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:18,552
I've never mentioned anything
to him about getting together.

245
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:21,856
I wouldn't mix social and professional.
That's a terrible combination.

246
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,088
Well, I'm just gonna tell him

247
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:27,122
we're going out of town
or something.

248
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,691
- Okay.
- Because if we go over to his house

249
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:31,670
for dinner, we'll have to invite
him someplace.

250
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:33,638
If we don't, then
he's gonna be offended.

251
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:36,141
Then the next time I go there,
there's gonna be tension...

252
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:39,235
"I invited you, why didn't you
invite me?" You know what I mean?

253
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:41,542
- We don't want to get into that game.
- Um-mmm.

254
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:46,380
I'll need a new dentist soon,
there's no question about it.

255
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:49,513
That's the end of this dentist
for all intents and purposes.

256
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:51,580
I'm telling you,
it's already ruined.

257
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:54,718
The whole thing... ah,
everybody's got to get together.

258
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:57,525
"Got to get together."
The whole world's got to get together.

259
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:04,428
Hey. How about this?

260
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,199
That's what you want
the waiters to wear?

261
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,672
Yeah, why not?

262
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:10,505
So you want the waiters
to dress like you?

263
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,067
Why is that bad?

264
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:14,136
Oh, man, you're
out of control.

265
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,779
No, they should walk around
looking like you.

266
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:19,808
- I didn't say that.
- Well...?

267
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:22,818
What about this?

268
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:26,188
- Hey, what about this?
- Come on.

269
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:28,284
- It looks like a tablecloth, right?
- Yeah.

270
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:29,658
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

271
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,925
So, the waiters' shirts
match the tablecloth.

272
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:35,058
- And?
- What do you mean, "and"?

273
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,035
That's interesting.

274
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,402
- Interesting?
- Yeah!

275
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,308
I'm not finding anything.

276
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:46,470
We got to get out of here. There's
nothing here. I'm gonna get...

277
00:12:46,512 --> 00:12:48,844
remember that shirt I was wearing
that Ted Danson liked?

278
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,508
- That cream shirt?
- With the black?

279
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,609
- I think I'll get that for him.
- That's nice.

280
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:54,415
- I got it here.
- That's very nice.

281
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:57,150
I might even get
another one for me.

282
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,317
- Why?
- 'Cause I always ruin my shirts.

283
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:02,384
I stain them and I'd like...
it would be good to have an extra one.

284
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:04,919
Is it crazy to have two
of the same shirt?

285
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:08,456
No, it's fine. You get a stain on it,
you got another one.

286
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:11,503
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

287
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:13,869
I don't know if you remember.
I was in a couple days ago,

288
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:16,374
I bought a two-tone shirt.
You had three in the basement.

289
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:18,104
Yeah, the cream and black.

290
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:22,012
- I want to get the other two.
- Just give me one second.

291
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:31,785
- Check that out.
- Man, she is hot.

292
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:34,952
Look at that shirt.
Is that a beauty, the epaulets?

293
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:37,292
- Look at the epaulets.
- It's a military shirt.

294
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,423
Yes, exactly,
it's a military shirt.

295
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:41,228
I don't know where
you're going with this.

296
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,758
- Have you ever been to the mess hall?
- No, I never have.

297
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:46,135
Have you ever seen
well-dressed soldiers eating?

298
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:48,868
- No, I've never been in the military.
- You should eat there.

299
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:50,933
- Have you eaten in a mess hall?
- Yes, I have.

300
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:53,036
- Really?
- I never ate in an officers' mess hall,

301
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,207
But I can imagine they're all there
in their brilliant uniforms.

302
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:58,945
- When were you in the military?
- Years ago,

303
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:01,010
but that has nothing
to do with anything.

304
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:02,611
Excuse me.
I don't normally do this,

305
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:05,852
but I know you from somewhere
and I just can't place it.

306
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:07,917
Burt Bondy.
I think I know you

307
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,951
from the 12:15
spin class at the gym.

308
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:11,964
Burt?

309
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,966
No, I've never taken
a spin class, sorry.

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,434
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

311
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:19,336
Are you "a friend of Bill W.'s"?
In the program?

312
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:21,772
AA? I think I know you
from there, don't I?

313
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:24,776
No, I wish you did. it sounds like
a nice place to hang out.

314
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,370
Where do I know...?
What is your name?

315
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:31,680
- Larry David.
- Larry David, Burt Bondy.

316
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:35,050
I know you from the waiting room
at the dentist's office.

317
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:37,817
Dr. Blore.
We have the same dentist.

318
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:40,348
Oh, okay, okay,
yeah, yeah, right.

319
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:42,088
Burt Bondy.

320
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:46,258
- I don't actually go to him anymore.
- I still see him. I run into him,

321
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:49,063
- I'll tell him you said hello.
- You don't have to.

322
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:50,762
You don't want me
to say hello?

323
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:53,271
It's kind of a trite thing
to say to somebody anyway...

324
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:56,605
- "Someone says hello"...
- I hear what you're saying.

325
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:58,735
Very high level.
I got to get there.

326
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:00,746
- That's good.
- Yeah.

327
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,806
- Okay, it was nice meeting you.
- Okay, Burt, take care.

328
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:07,177
Burt Bondy?
What was that all about?

329
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,949
My dentist invited me
out to dinner.

330
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:11,786
I'm supposed to be going tonight,
and I told him I was out of town.

331
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:13,655
Sir?

332
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:16,856
- Last two.
- Great.

333
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:27,065
It's kind of got a little French
quality to it, no?

334
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:30,439
Yeah, French Foreign Legion,
maybe, but, no.

335
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,967
They might think we have
Scientologists for wait people.

336
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:36,641
Are you kidding me? You don't like this?
Is that what you're saying?

337
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:39,617
I look at that and I see we're
serving airline food.

338
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:43,452
- I'm sorry.
- Can I show mine? All right.

339
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:46,151
Simple, simple, simple.

340
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:52,226
This is the shirt...
crisp, clean, beautiful.

341
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,324
Now, here's where
it all comes together.

342
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,495
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present... the vest.

343
00:15:57,536 --> 00:16:00,937
A vest, a vest,
a navy vest.

344
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:03,806
Simple, lovely.
It feels good.

345
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:06,073
- It's a vest!
- Upscale.

346
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:07,773
It's very classy, right?

347
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:09,940
It's along the lines of what
we're talking about.

348
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:11,847
Actual applause, mind you.

349
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:15,047
- That's my favorite.
- You really like that?

350
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:17,453
- Classic.
- I like it.

351
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:20,992
I got you a present.

352
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:26,220
Oh, look at that. That's the shirt
you wore the other day.

353
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:28,290
That's nice.

354
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:31,201
That's great. Thanks, Lar,
that's really sweet of you.

355
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:35,169
- Oh, gee, look at that.
- A little rip there.

356
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:37,801
My God, I'm sorry.

357
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:42,542
Well, just take it back.
I'm sure they'll fix it for you.

358
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,084
Uh... couldn't you
take it back?

359
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:49,110
I don't even know
where this store is.

360
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:55,889
It's on Wilshire and Eighth.
I don't understand.

361
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:58,158
You want me to take it back?
I just gave you a gift.

362
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:00,358
You gave me
a defective shirt.

363
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,367
It's got a hole in it.
That's not a gift.

364
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:05,962
I don't own this shirt anymore,
as I see it. I gave it to you.

365
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,235
- It's your responsibility.
- It's not the point.

366
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:10,242
The point is, if you give
somebody a gift,

367
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:12,608
it's supposed
to be a gift, not a problem.

368
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:15,671
And if you give somebody a gift,
they're not supposed to be an ingrate.

369
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:17,512
All right, how about
I give you a gift,

370
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,576
and you have to pick it up in Seattle?
That's a problem, not a gift.

371
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,985
- It's not quite the same thing.
I'm giving you a gift.

372
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:26,150
It is the same thing.
I appreciate the gesture. Thank you.

373
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,592
Fine, I'll keep the shirt.

374
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:31,255
- Great.
- I can use an extra shirt.

375
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:33,629
- You took a nice thought,
and all of a sudden it's like-

376
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,499
- You took a nice thought...
- I'm sorry.

377
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:38,935
So we're going with
the blue shirt and the vest?

378
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:41,030
Thank you, everybody,
I appreciate that.

379
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,274
It just seems like
you're taunting Ted.

380
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:50,908
- I'm not taunting him.
- Taunting him...

381
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,942
When I buy a new shirt,
I like to wear it a lot, so what?

382
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:55,920
- I didn't think about him
when I put it on.

383
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:58,014
- Okay. Hi!
- Hey.

384
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,116
Hi, Jill, happy birthday!

385
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:02,593
Hi, Larry.

386
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:04,994
- Hi, Ted. Good to see you.
- Thanks for coming.

387
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,827
I like your tiara, that's nice.

388
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:09,391
Fifth birthday,
this is very cool.

389
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:12,029
So let's get going.
Where's my Lion costume? I'm ready.

390
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:15,666
Actually, change of plans.
I want Jeff to do the Lion.

391
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,403
- You are the Lion.
- Hey, yes.

392
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,570
You can be
the Tin Man.

393
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:22,103
- Dorothy.
- Dorothy, please. Thanks. That's great.

394
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:23,911
I don't want
to do the Tin Man.

395
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:26,782
I have no connection to the Tin Man,
I don't like the Tin Man.

396
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:29,617
It's a kid's party.
You'll be fine, Lar, really.

397
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:33,113
- Why'd you take me off the Lion?
- No reason.

398
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,389
No reason?
There's got to be a reason.

399
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:37,760
Larry, it's a party.
Let's lighten up, come on.

400
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:40,288
- You'll be fine.
- Is it 'cause of the shirt?

401
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:42,425
'Cause I wore the shirt?
Because of the shirt?

402
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:44,902
No, don't be silly, Larry.

403
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:47,269
- Help me out here.
- It's a party.

404
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:48,796
Let's have a good time.

405
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:51,173
If I can't do the Lion,
I won't do the Tin Man.

406
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,303
- I don't like the Tin Man.
- Well, all right,

407
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:56,075
We'll find someone else.
I'll be right back, sweetheart,

408
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:59,016
- I'm gonna get that other gift.
- Yeah, find somebody else.

409
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:01,349
What an A-S-S-H-O-L-E.

410
00:19:01,387 --> 00:19:02,877
- Okay.
- Hey!

411
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:06,380
What? She's five years old.
She doesn't know how to spell.

412
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:10,391
I'm not gonna do the Tin Man.

413
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:12,659
Ha-ha-ha, ho-ho-ho,
and a couple of tra-la-las...

414
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:16,429
Very close.
Oh, the Tin Man is too good.

415
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:20,065
Let me hear you
do the voice. Do it.

416
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:22,539
- I don't do the voice.
- What do you mean?

417
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,975
- I don't do impressions.
- Why say you can do the Lion?

418
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,875
I'm the Lion!
I don't have to do the voice.

419
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:28,573
He's doing a great job.

420
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:30,775
Did you see us come down
the Yellow Brick Road?

421
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:33,683
- We're having fun, all right?
- Oof...!

422
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:36,882
- Larry!
- Oh-hh!

423
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:41,318
- Oh, oh, Larry, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God!

424
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,850
She broke my teeth!

425
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:44,795
She didn't mean to, Larry.

426
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,731
All right,
let's get some ice.

427
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:50,291
- Oh, my shirt!
- Oh my God!

428
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:52,270
My shirt!

429
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:55,796
- We've got to get you to a dentist.
- A dentist? It's Sunday.

430
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:59,072
- They're not open on Sunday.
- We'll have to call Dr. Blore.

431
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:01,477
Dr. Blore?

432
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,709
Burt Bondy.

433
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:13,820
Ah-hh...!
You know what?

434
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:15,827
Maybe I need a little
more novocaine.

435
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:18,159
No, it's gonna kick in.
It's fine, yeah.

436
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:20,188
Still a little something?

437
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:22,200
- It's getting there?
- A little bit.

438
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,327
It's getting there.
I feel it getting numb.

439
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,430
Good, I'll give it a minute.

440
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:30,408
Anyway, thanks for doing this.

441
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:33,172
I know dentists
don't like to come in on Sundays.

442
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:34,941
It's like a sacred day.

443
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,244
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday,
you know?

444
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:40,013
- But I appreciate it.
- Not a problem.

445
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:43,920
Happy to do it.
Sure missed you last Saturday.

446
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:47,391
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm so sorry.

447
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:49,894
- How did it turn out?
- Oh, it was nice, but, you know...

448
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:53,023
It would've been great.
I'm so sorry I couldn't make it.

449
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:56,466
- Have a good trip?
- Yeah, we went up to Sonoma.

450
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:58,970
My cousin's got
a pear farm up there.

451
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:01,871
A pear farm?
Like an orchard, right?

452
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:03,397
Bartlett pears.

453
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:05,307
Bartlett, those are...
I like pears.

454
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,869
They're delicious,

455
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:10,279
but all weekend long,
pear after pear.

456
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:12,682
- Pears in everything, sure.
- Boy, oh, boy,

457
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:14,879
I was getting the runs
up there after a while.

458
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,785
Well, fruit will do that.

459
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:20,690
I'd much rather have been in your house
on Saturday night than eating pears.

460
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:22,626
And it's relatives.
What are you gonna do?

461
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:26,654
- Right, right.
- And we visited the cabin where...

462
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:30,066
Bob Bartlett...
who the pear's named after?

463
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:32,662
- The guy named Bob Bartlett.
- I didn't realize the pear was named...

464
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:35,367
- In the early part of the 20th century.
- Here in the...

465
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:38,501
Yeah, right here...
up in Sonoma... Bob Bartlett.

466
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:43,612
And we went to his...
saw his cabin and everything.

467
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:45,446
And he's still got
relatives there.

468
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:48,476
Yeah, and they're still making a living
off of these pears

469
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,454
for over 100 years now.

470
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:52,457
Everybody knows
a Bartlett pear, right?

471
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:55,051
The Bartletts are...
they run the town there.

472
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:59,190
- That's that a green pear, right?
- No, it's a brown pear.

473
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:03,327
They start off green,
then they turn brown.

474
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:07,669
I thought that was the Bosc
that was the brown.

475
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:10,197
No, no. It's the Bartlett.

476
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:13,336
Burt Bondy
was in this week.

477
00:22:16,281 --> 00:22:18,772
Burt Bondy?

478
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,785
Do I know him? I don't know.

479
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:22,844
- He seems to think you do.
- Really?

480
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:24,549
Mm-hmm.

481
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,423
- Burt Bondy.
- I don't think so.

482
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:32,026
I think we're ready.

483
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,071
Did she hurt you?

484
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:49,046
She tried to, didn't she?

485
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:51,106
Come on...

486
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,414
- Honey?
- Yeah.

487
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,647
How did it go?

488
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:02,487
Look at that. These are supposed
to be temporaries, okay?

489
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:04,758
See the size of these things?

490
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:06,890
He did it on purpose... Blore.

491
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:09,594
Because Bondy obviously told
him that he ran into me

492
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:12,832
and I wasn't out of town,
And he did this to get even.

493
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:16,307
- They're only temporaries.
- I know they're only temporaries,

494
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:19,105
but temporaries aren't supposed
to look like Ch/c/ets/

495
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:21,738
- Look at the size of these things.
- That's about right.

496
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,010
- You don't know...
- I know what I'm talking about.

497
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:27,212
- You don't know about temporaries.
- How do you know?

498
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:30,016
I can imagine that you know
very little about temporaries.

499
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:32,853
I don't want to have a conversation
with you about temporaries.

500
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,655
- That's what they look like.
- Like I want to talk about temporaries?

501
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:37,252
Did you see what's on?

502
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:42,063
- Zeke, you're just as scared as I am.
- Oh, wonderful.

503
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:46,367
If you just would've done the Tin Man,
none of this would've happened.

504
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:49,169
Maybe Jill did it on purpose too.
That's a possibility.

505
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,075
Maybe you shouldn't have
called Ted an asshole.

506
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:54,873
Look at this shirt.
Look at this.

507
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:58,945
Fortunately I have
two more upstairs...

508
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:02,181
The one I bought for Ted,
and I bought an extra one, see?

509
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:05,490
You know,
it's not funny, Cheryl.

510
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:08,152
- I got hit in the mouth with a bat!
- I'm sorry,

511
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:10,753
I honestly am
concerned about that.

512
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:12,991
- Who the hell is that?
- That's Barbara with the frame.

513
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:19,134
Hey, I'm so sorry.
Can I come in?

514
00:24:19,171 --> 00:24:21,662
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

515
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,733
I am so sorry.
That's an awful thing to happen.

516
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:26,972
- How you doing?
- Great.

517
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:28,946
Let me see.

518
00:24:28,981 --> 00:24:32,178
- Wow, they're big, aren't they?
- Yeah, they're very big.

519
00:24:32,217 --> 00:24:34,742
- They hurt?
- No.

520
00:24:34,787 --> 00:24:36,914
I'm so sorry.

521
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:39,423
You know what?
Can I just give you a word of advice?

522
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:42,689
- Yes, absolutely.
- Forget the piñata parties, okay?

523
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:46,061
It's a dangerous game.
You could see what could happen...

524
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:48,157
you got kids swinging
baseball bats around.

525
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,827
And even if the candy
comes down,

526
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:52,393
then you've got vultures
coming and getting candy,

527
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:55,702
stuffing it in their pocket,
killing each other to get to the candy.

528
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:58,801
It's a crazy game, it's dangerous.
I don't know how the Spaniards do it.

529
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:01,335
How long have they
been doing this piñata?

530
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,178
Not one Spanish person has
figured out that the piñata

531
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:05,683
is a sick fucking game?

532
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:09,483
I hope you know Jill
did not do that on purpose.

533
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:11,921
Really, she feels
terrible about it.

534
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:15,518
You shouldn't have called me
an asshole in front of her, but...

535
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:18,587
- She's a pretty good speller.
- Yeah.

536
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,621
Five years old,
she can spell "asshole."

537
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,156
That's pretty good.

538
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:23,896
Hey, you know what?
On the way up here,

539
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:26,268
I was thinking,
I would like that shirt.

540
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:28,933
I'll take it and I'll exchange it.
It was a great gift.

541
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:31,909
You can't exchange anymore.
They're out.

542
00:25:31,944 --> 00:25:33,741
- There's no more left.
- It doesn't matter.

543
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,577
I can take it to a shirt guy,
he'll fix it.

544
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:39,413
This one's ruined,
as you can see,

545
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:43,182
and I was kind of planning
on keeping the other one.

546
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:44,849
The one you gave me?

547
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,358
The one you gave
back to me.

548
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:49,360
I only gave it
back to you

549
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:51,794
because you were being rude
about me having to exchange it.

550
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,856
You still nevertheless
didn't accept my gracious gift,

551
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,232
- and you gave it back to me.
- Why are you doing this?

552
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:59,760
Every time we get together,
we push and pull like this.

553
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:01,966
You should have kept the shirt
in the first place...

554
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,373
Larry, Larry! I'm trying to watch
"The Wizard of Oz."

555
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:07,708
You just said you have
two shirts upstairs.

556
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:10,180
Go upstairs,
give Ted his shirt,

557
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:12,479
and you'll have one
for yourself.

558
00:26:12,517 --> 00:26:14,747
Hi, Ted.

559
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:18,847
You got two sh/rts?

560
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:27,030
Well, I bought
an extra one.

561
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:40,441
Somewhere
over the rainbow...

562
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,944
Hey.

563
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:47,110
Just put it down.

564
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:51,452
There's a land
that I heard of

565
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,085
Once in a lullaby

566
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:00,931
Somewhere
over the rainbow...

567
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:03,491
Oh. that's Barbara.

568
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:08,439
So, the restaurant...
you in?

569
00:27:08,473 --> 00:27:11,340
Yeah, I'm going in
for the same amount as you.

570
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:13,401
Yeah?

571
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,936
- Yeah, you got a problem?
- No, no.

572
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,642
- Is that all right? Yeah?
- Yeah.

573
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:21,141
- Okay.
- All right, that looks great.

574
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:24,019
- I thought it came out really well.
- It really did.

575
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:26,581
I'm sorry it took
such a long time.

576
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:30,755
- It's just, with Chet... you understand.
- I know, I know.

577
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:32,957
Yeah, that looks good.

578
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:35,262
Oh, we're watching
"The Wizard of Oz."

579
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,532
You want to come back?
Come on.

580
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:43,837
Oh, why can't I?

581
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:46,400
Come on in,
have a seat.

582
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:48,072
Barbara,
do you know Ted?

583
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:52,174
Hi. Oh, my God, oh...

584
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:55,744
This was our movie.
Chet loved this song.

585
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:58,278
If happy little
bluebirds fly

586
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:00,951
Beyond the rainbow...

587
00:28:02,394 --> 00:28:04,487
Chet's shirt...!

588
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:31,285
No, no!

589
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:50,073
Hey, asshole!
