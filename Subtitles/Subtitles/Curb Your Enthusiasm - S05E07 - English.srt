Episode 5x07: The Seder

2
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,800
Morning!

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,600
- Need some help?
- Be great. That'd be great.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,100
Okay.

5
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,900
Hey, I'll do it. Don't worry about it. Relax.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,400
- I got it.
- Nice, thank you.

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,100
- What is this, grape juice?
- Yes, grape juice.

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,900
- You guys drink grape juice?
- Sure we do, it's a great antioxidant.

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,600
- Come on over and have some.
- You never see people drinking grape juice.

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,600
- It's delicious, you'd love it.
- I think it's a very underrated juice.

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,804
- It is!
- I wonder why more people don't buy it.

12
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:00,102
Larry.

13
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:04,600
Larry. Did you know that a sex offender moved into the neighborhood?

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,500
- Yeah, I saw his picture on a flyer.
- I know, it's terrible!

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,600
Yeah, he's a bald guy, too.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
- A bald guy.
- Yeah, a bald guy.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,000
- It's very bad for the bald community.
- Oh, Larry.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,500
What's very bad for the community is that he's a sex offender.

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I know, as long as he's gonna be a sex offender I wish he had a full head of hair.

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,700
- Oh, Larry!
- Let me ask you a question.

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,500
Have you...

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,700
Have you guys been getting your newspaper?

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,100
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,600
- You have?
- Yes.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,400
Hmm. I haven't gotten my paper in six days.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,400
I did see somebody walk up your walkway there,

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
pick up your newspaper...
- What?!

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,900
But I figured maybe it was somebody that you knew because he had on a suit.

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,200
A guy in a suit is taking my paper?

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,300
That's why she thought it might your friend of yours,

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,300
the guy was well dressed.
- Jesus! That's crazy!

32
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,700
- Well, you know.
- Guy in a suit is taking my newspaper?

33
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,700
A suit's a good cover if a guy's gonna steal a paper.

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,900
If you saw him again, would you know him?

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,400
Yeah yeah, I'm pretty sure I'd know him.

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,900
A guy in a suit? Huh?

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,900
- Makes no sense.
- Stealing papers?

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,700
- Makes no sense.
- I know.

39
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,400
I don't get it.

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,900
I don't get it at all.

41
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,600
What's a motivation there?

42
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,100
Guy in a suit's gotta be able to afford a paper.

43
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,700
Yeah. Hey, you coming to passover seder?

44
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,700
- Cheryl's doing a seder, huh?
- Yeah, for my father.

45
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Does she know what she's doing?

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,900
- I don't know, she'll find out.
- A little problem.

47
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,100
Susie's sister's in town, which means my brother-in-law's in town

48
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,300
which means that their kid's in town and

49
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,300
my brother-in-law is a little...

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,800
- He's a conservative?
- He's a conservative.

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,200
- Your brother-in-law's a conservative?
- Big time.

52
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,000
- Big time conservative
- Do you want to bring him to the seder?

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
- Yeah.
- Fine, I don't care.

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
- All right!
- Okay.

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,100
- I'll talk to you later.
- All right, very good.

56
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,100
- Thanks for lunch!
- Sure.

57
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
These machines are really finicky.

58
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,800
Yeah, let me give you a hand with that.

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,300
No no no no.

60
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,900
- No, let me help you out.
- No, I don't even care... you know what?

61
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,300
- I don't even care...
- I know how to get this. I've got the touch.

62
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,300
- I don't even need to read it.
- Watch watch watch watch.

63
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,000
I just know how to do it. I know this machine.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go ahead.

65
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,300
You want one?

66
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,300
Yeah, but I'll close it again and pay for it, because, you know.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
- It's just...
- Oh. Okay.

68
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,600
- Okay, well...
- Yeah.

69
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
- Thanks a lot.
- Hey, I'm sorry, you're...

70
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,100
you're Larry David, right?

71
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you like this.

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,800
I never, ever do this.

73
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,900
But, you know, I'm sort of new to the neighborhood

74
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,900
and I'm a huge "Seinfeld" fan.

75
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,000
- No kidding?
- Yeah, the biggest.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,100
- Seriously? Get out of here.
- Yeah yeah yeah, seriously.

77
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,000
No, I'm, probably the biggest "Seinfeld" fan ever.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,100
- What a great show. I miss it. I miss it!
- Ah, go on.

79
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
"Puffy shirt" is my favorite episode.

80
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,400
You know what? I love that show.

81
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,200
- Really?
- That's one of my favorite episodes.

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,500
Yeah, it's great. It's great.

83
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,200
How did you guys come up with the low talker?

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Well...

85
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
I mean it was pretty easy to come up with.

86
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,600
I was out to dinner with one.

87
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,800
And then you write it and you put it on the tv.

88
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,000
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'm not an artist, you know?

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,400
So it's interesting to see how an artist like yourself works.

90
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,100
Well, that's very nice of you. Thank you.

91
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,400
- It's incredible. It's really an honor.
- Oh my god, thank you so much.

92
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,300
I'm Rick Leftowitz.

93
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
- Great to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

94
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,800
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thank you.

95
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,700
Oh, boy, look at the jew girl.

96
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,600
- I am so jewish right now.
- Holy cow!

97
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,300
Where did you learn how to do this?

98
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,600
Well, Susie's been coaching me through it all.

99
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,900
- She has?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,900
- Do you even know what this thing is called?
- This is a, uh...

101
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
haroset.

102
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,400
- Very good.
- It's a lot like ambrosia, except...

103
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,000
I wish my mother were alive to hear you say that word out loud.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, I wish my mother could hear me say...

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,600
my mother would flip if she knew I was doing this.

106
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,600
- Looks good.
- Thank you. I mean, I'm trying.

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
It seems like a lot of trouble you people go through for this.

108
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,100
- You know what I mean?
- <i>"You people"</i> I dunno if I like that so much.

109
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,400
- You jews, is that better?
- That's better, yeah.

110
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,700
Okay, I feel like I've been cutting apples for like two hours.

111
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,900
Okay, hey, you know what?

112
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,100
Marla and Mark got back together.

113
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

114
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,200
- I know I'm really happy.
- Good for them.

115
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,400
Good for them!

116
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,200
I thought you'd be happy to hear that.

117
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,200
That's nice. That's nice. When did this happen?

118
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,900
About a week ago, and he moved back in with her.

119
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,300
- Really?
- Yeah.

120
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,900
- Wow.
- And they're coming tomorrow.

121
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,800
- Oh, you know who else is coming?
- Who?

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,600
Jeff asked me if he could bring his in-laws.

123
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I know, I know, I talked to Susie.

124
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,100
- I've been cutting apples...
- Jeez, you know what I just realized?

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,600
I never followed through on my Christmas present to Mark.

126
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Remember I got him a subscription to "The Times"?

127
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,300
- "The New York Times".
- Yeah.

128
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,300
And then he and Marla broke up.

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,100
I don't know. I kinda forgot about it.

130
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
So you just didn't give him his gift?

131
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,500
Yeah.

132
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
- Because he broke up with his girlfriend?
- Well it's... yeah.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,500
I don't see the point to it.

134
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
No, you just thought that you wouldn't have to worry about it and

135
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,100
- you wouldn't see him again, so who cares?
- Oh my god.

136
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,600
What?

137
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,200
I'll bet you Mark...

138
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I'll bet you Mark is the guy who's taking the paper.

139
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,600
No, think about it, seriously. Listen, think about it.

140
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,100
I can't believe it.

141
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,200
Mark is stealing the paper.

142
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,300
Holy shit!

143
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,600
Don't you see? Look...

144
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,004
How long have we not been getting it, six days?

145
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,302
He moved back in with her a week ago.

146
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:21,400
You just said that, right?

147
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,200
Who else would be doing it? It's him.

148
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,200
- Mark is not stealing our newspaper.
- No?

149
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,500
- That is the most ridiculous...
- I don't think so.

150
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, I think so.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,900
Larry, he's a doctor.

152
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,100
I think he could afford the paper if he wants to get a paper.

153
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
Yeah, but not if he's upset with somebody

154
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,300
who promised him a gift for Christmas and never followed through on it.

155
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,800
- That is so ridiculous.
- It's not ridiculous. It makes perfect sense.

156
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,300
You know, because I spoke to...

157
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,700
hey, you know...

158
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,100
you know what we should do?

159
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,400
What?

160
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,600
We should invite...

161
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,500
We should invite Mac and Ethel.

162
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,000
We should invite them for seder, don't you think?

163
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
You want to invite Ethel and Mac?

164
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,900
I had no idea you liked Mac and Ethel so much.

165
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,900
You don't understand because you're not jewish, okay?

166
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,800
But it's a jewish thing.

167
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,200
It's sort of like a tradition, you know?

168
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,700
Invite the cranky neighbors who...

169
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,000
well, if jews don't have any place to go for seder, you're supposed to invite them.

170
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,000
Come on. Come on.

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Invite 'em.

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,100
Hey, Larry.

173
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,200
- Hey. Rick, yeah.
- Hey, Rick, from the...

174
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,400
Hey, let me give you a hand here.

175
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,300
- Okay. Oh, thank you.
- Yeah. How are ya?

176
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,100
Pretty good. Pretty good.

177
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,100
I should have taken one of those carts, you know, but...

178
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,300
- Yeah, I know.
- Look, it's downhill.

179
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,300
I'm worried it'll just hit a car and I'll get in a lawsuit or something.

180
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,500
- Who the hell knows?
- I know.

181
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Hey, what do you got there?

182
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Oh, my four iron.

183
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,500
You play golf?

185
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Yeah, and I eat and I breathe.

186
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,100
- In that order.
- Yeah, me, too.

187
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,600
- Really?
- Absolutely, yeah.

188
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
Wow, wow.

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,400
Anyway, I replaced the four iron with a nine wood.

190
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,900
I can't hit it anymore.

191
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Well, you know what? I would love to help you.

192
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,200
Oh, come on. Nobody could help me. Nobody!

193
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,400
People have tried before. It can't be done.

194
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,300
- Look I'm...
- Can't be done, Rick.

195
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,800
I've been golfing for a long time.

196
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,300
I'm fairly good.

197
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, in my backyard, I have this setup that you won't believe.

198
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
I've got a net, I've got a tee.

199
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,300
- Get the hell out of here!

200
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,900
And I've got a camera...
- Really, a camera?

201
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,100
and you shoot yourself swinging and then analyze your swing frame-by-frame.

202
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,200
- What are you doing now?
- Nothing.

203
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,300
- All right, let's go.
- Right now?

204
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,200
Okay, where's your car?

205
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,700
I don't have one.

206
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,400
- Okay, I'll take you.
- Okay.

207
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,000
You want some cheetos for the trip, huh?

208
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,700
- Yeah, why not?
- Great.

209
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,200
All right, it's gonna be fun.

210
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
I love golf.

211
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,300
- Oh my god. Did you see the whole thing?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

212
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,600
Come here. Come here.

213
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Look at this. Watch it in slow motion, okay?

214
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,300
Look at that.

215
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,600
See, you're bringing your hips through.

216
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,100
It doesn't even look... who is that?

217
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,800
- Is that me? It doesn't even look like me.
- It's you.

218
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,900
Look, look, I wanna freeze it right here.

219
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,100
Wait, right there.

220
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,100
- Look at your hips right here.
- Yeah, no, I see. Perfect.

221
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,500
I can't believe it.

222
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,500
A+... My best student of the day.

223
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Good work. Okay.

224
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,300
- All right. Great.
- Unreal.

225
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,800
- Listen, anytime, anytime.
- I'm completely spent.

226
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,800
- It's my pleasure.
- Fantastic.

227
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,600
That was great. That was just great.

228
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,700
- Yeah, yeah.
- Could not have been better.

229
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,200
What are you doing for passover?

230
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,100
Just having some people over.

231
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,400
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, what are you doing?

232
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,700
Nothing, nothing. Totally free.

233
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,300
- You want to come to my house?
- No, really?

234
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,400
- All right.
- Okay, okay.

235
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,700
- Great, great.
- You don't have to.

236
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,100
No, that sounds great.

237
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
I got nothing else to do.

238
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,900
- You sure?
- Yeah, of course, thank you.

239
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Yeah, I'll bring latkes.

240
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,000
- Okay.
- Great, great.

241
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,200
I'll see you then. I'm gonna hit a few.

242
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,200
What took you so long? Where were you?

243
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,900
Well, I met sort of a new friend.

244
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,700
He's kind of new in town.

245
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,700
And we got to talking. Golf nut, okay?

246
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,000
Took me to his backyard. He's got a net.

247
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What a setup this guy... my life is changed.

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Today, changed, irrevocably.

249
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
And you just started talking to a stranger?

250
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,300
Yeah, kind of, well, you know, he knew me from "Seinfeld".

251
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,600
You know, he's...

252
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,400
- Fan?
- Yeah, kind of.

253
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,400
And gonna be alone on passover, and...

254
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,500
I kind of invited him to the seder.

255
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,300
I hope you don't mind.

256
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,200
- You did?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

257
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,300
- No, that's okay.
- Really?

258
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,500
- Well, if he's alone.
- Aren't you a doll?

259
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,800
Well, that's cute.

260
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm glad you made a new friend.

261
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,500
- Yeah, okay, yeah.
- That's nice.

262
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,400
I don't hear that very often from you.

263
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,300
Oh, and I forgot to mention it's that sex offender.

264
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,700
What?

265
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,400
You know, we saw that picture on the flyer of that sex offender guy.

266
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,700
That's him.

267
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,700
- He's cool.
- You invited a sex offender over for seder?

268
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,100
Are you out of your mind?

269
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,000
- It was an awkward moment.
- What is wrong with you, Larry?

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,100
You don't do something like that without asking me!

271
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,900
You do not invite a sex offender over for dinner

272
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
without talking to me first!

273
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,000
We're not having a sex offender over for dinner, no!

274
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,500
- You need to call him and say no.
- Cheryl...

275
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,600
What would Jesus do?

276
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,100
- Cheryl, Cheryl.
- No, no!

277
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,500
Cheryl, he's a jew.

278
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,800
He's a jew!

279
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,300
This is a fact. This is like numbers, okay?

280
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,400
Have you heard of the theory of the 77?

281
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,300
- No.
- Okay, every 77 years there's a great president.

282
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,400
Washington and then you go 77 years, Lincoln.

283
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,400
77 years there's... what's that guy's name?

284
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,100
- Theodore Roosevelt?
- F.D.R.

285
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,400
And then another 77 years, you got W.

286
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
- Really?
- I think we're in historic times.

287
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,700
- Washington, Lincoln, F.D.R.
- And W.

288
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,700
- And George W. Bush.
- That's right.

289
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,300
And we're turning the whole damn world around.

290
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,800
- Jake, did you remember to call your mother?
- What?

291
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,400
Did you remember to call your mother? We were supposed to call her before...

292
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,000
I told my mother I would call her after the seder.

293
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,300
- You said "before".
- After the seder.

294
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,100
- Hey.
- Hey, Larry.

295
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,400
- How's it going, Mark?
- Doing well, doing well.

296
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,300
- How's the doctor?
- Doing well, busy.

297
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,900
- Oh, yeah.
- Real busy.

298
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,200
You know, just kind of... things are booming right now, you know?

299
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,700
Nice to see you and Marla back together.

300
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,400
She's great. She's great.

301
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,500
Yeah, what happened? You couldn't cut it in your single life there?

302
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Couldn't get any dates, so you went back?

303
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
That's funny.

304
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,400
Part of the perk of being a doctor.

305
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,700
It's not hard to get dates.

306
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,600
Get to see a lot of women naked?

307
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,600
- Cosmetic surgeon. Seen my fair share.
- Really?

308
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,900
You ever get aroused?

309
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,400
I don't think that's really an appropriate question.

310
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,900
- Really, why not?
- Well, you know, it's just...

311
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,400
it's sort of a personal thing.

312
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,600
I don't want to discuss something like that. The answer of course is no.

313
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,900
I'm a professional. People come to me for help. I help them.

314
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,900
I understand.

315
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Tell me if you think this is an appropriate question.

316
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And I mean no disrespect.

317
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Have you been stealing my newspaper?

318
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
Larry...

319
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,300
- Yes, that is an inappropriate question.
- Okay, so that's two inappropriate questions.

320
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,600
I have not been stealing your newspaper, Larry. That's appalling.

321
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,400
- Really?
- Yeah, really, Larry.

322
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm quite sure I haven't been taking it.

323
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,500
Are you positive, Mark?

324
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,500
Okay.

325
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,800
Now if you'll excuse me.

326
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,000
So what did you think of my brother-in-law?

327
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,600
- Whoa.
- Uh-huh.

328
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,600
- Man. Wow.
- Big time. Wow.

329
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
What?

330
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,100
- Your sister's husband.
- Man, oh, man.

331
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,300
- He's nauseating.
- He's quite a piece of work that guy.

332
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,600
He's quite a piece of work!

333
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,100
Who else is coming?

334
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Oh, there's somebody right now.

335
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,700
- Hey, there he is.
- Somebody order latkes?

336
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,500
Look at this. Boy, oh, boy.

337
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,600
- Yeah, how are ya?
- Great, how you doing?

338
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,300
- Very good.
- Good to see you.

339
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,800
- Yeah, this is nice.
- Oh, yeah?

340
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,100
Let me introduce you to some of my friends here.

341
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,100
- The guests.
- Great.

342
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
Hi.

343
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,100
- This is Marla.
- Hi, Marla, nice to meet you. Rick.

344
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,000
And this is my wife Cheryl.

345
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,400
It's lovely to meet you. You have a wonderful home.

346
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

347
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
- I made latkes. Yeah.
- Latkes.

348
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Thank you, that was...

349
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,700
- From my mother's recipe.
- They smell good.

350
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,600
Hey, this guy completely changed my life. I'm telling you.

351
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,900
I can't believe the way I hit the ball now on account of him.

352
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Yeah, just wait till I'm done with him. Different man altogether.

353
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
I can't wait.

354
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,500
Nice to meet you.

355
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,000
Come on over here.

356
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,600
This here is Jeff.

357
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,100
- You are?
- This is Rick Leftowitz.

358
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,900
- Nice meeting you, Rick.
- Nice meeting you.

359
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,900
- This is Susie. His wife Susie.
- Hi.

360
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,900
- And that's Sammy.
- Somebody drop a cute bomb in here?

361
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,000
Oh, hey, and this is my dad.

362
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,800
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

363
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,100
Nice to meet you.

364
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,200
- This is Carol.
- Hi, Carol.

365
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,500
- Very nice to meet you.
- Rick. Nice to meet you.

366
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,300
- This is Emily and Jacob.
- Can I talk to you for a second?

367
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,800
Sure, yeah. Excuse me for one second.

368
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,600
What the hell are you trying to pull, Larry?

369
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,200
- What?
- You know who that guy is?

370
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,900
He had nowhere to go, what do you want me to do?

371
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't give a shit where he goes.

372
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,500
I think it's gonna be a big addition to this passover.

373
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,800
- In what way?
- He's got a good personality.

374
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,200
He's smart. He's funny.

375
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,200
He should not be in our presence on a holy day.

376
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,800
Any day.

377
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,300
What the hell are you doing?

378
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,000
- Larry.
- Hello, hello.

379
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,500
- How are you?
- Pretty good.

380
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,600
- Good to see you. I'm glad you came.
- So are we.

381
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Thank you.

382
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,400
Everybody parked in front of my house. Everybody here,

383
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
- except the kids.
- Yeah, so what?

384
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,800
- So what?
- Are you going out tonight?

385
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,800
I think you're here, aren't you? So what's the problem?

386
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,100
Everybody's got the car parked in front of my...

387
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,900
- same thing, every time you have a party...
- I'm sorry.

388
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,000
- I'll inform you next time.
- Please.

389
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Ethel, hi, how are you?

390
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,100
It was so nice of you to invite us.

391
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,400
My pleasure. Ethel, what I want you to do is

392
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,800
I want you to take a look around this room here, okay,

393
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,900
and just see if there's anybody who you recognize.

394
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,300
- Okay?
- Sure.

395
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,900
- All right, would you do that for me?
- Sure.

396
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,700
Take a look around.

397
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,600
Okay, gently. Gently, guys.

398
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,100
Let's put her here on the bed.

399
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Okay, let me just check her.

400
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,100
I think I hurt my back lifting her up.

401
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,600
Her pulse is okay. She's breathing fine.

402
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,300
- Does this happen often?
- Well, yeah, every once in a while

403
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,300
- something startles her.
- How long is she going to be out like this?

404
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,100
- A couple of hours.
- A couple of hours?!

405
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,200
What, are you kidding?

406
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Just a... you know, she'll sleep it off, then she'll be fine.

407
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Everybody have a nice big swig of wine.

408
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Hey, guess what.

409
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
Okay, get ready, kids.

410
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,700
You know what's in here?

411
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
Matzah.

412
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,700
And I'm gonna hide this, and you've got to go find it

413
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,700
and whoever finds the matzah is gonna get a dollar.

414
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Okay, a dollar!

415
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,800
All right, now go into the kitchen.

416
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Go in the kitchen.

417
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,700
Close your eyes. Don't look.

418
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,900
Cover your ears.

419
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,700
Okay, I'm gonna hide it now.

420
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,200
Don't look!

421
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,100
Okay, kids, you can come look for the matzah now.

422
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,200
- So, Larry.
- Yeah?

423
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Any luck in finding the guy that...

424
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,200
- has been stealing your newspaper?
- No.

425
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,000
No luck at all.

426
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,000
For those of you who don't know, I'm sure you don't,

427
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,800
somebody's been stealing my newspaper for an entire week...

428
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,700
yes, every day.

429
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,100
I tell you something, my wife, she got a good look at him.

430
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,900
I mean, a really good look.

431
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,900
If she ever sees him again, she'll recognize him.

432
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,700
- Really?
- She'll know that face.

433
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,200
She never forgets a face.

434
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,500
Is something wrong, doctor?

435
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Excuse me, uh, no.

436
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Just some gefilte fish.

437
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Well, hopefully, she'll wake up soon and

438
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,100
come down and join us for the rest of the seder.

439
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,700
- Wouldn't that be nice, everybody?
- Yes, yes.

440
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
That would be wonderful, wonderful!

441
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,300
Hey, there's no matzah here. Let's go, beat it.

442
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,800
Come on, pfft, beat it.

443
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,600
Well, I've... just seen Ethel.

444
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,300
She's coming around.

445
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,700
She should be down soon.

446
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,000
That's nice. That's nice.

447
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,500
Huh? Isn't that good news?

448
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,100
What is all the...

449
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,800
all that sound, that noise, the racket we all heard upstairs?

450
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,100
Oh, my foot fell asleep so I was kind of jumping up and down

451
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,500
to get the blood circulating again.

452
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,000
I hate when that happens, right?

453
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,300
Something wrong, doctor?

454
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
For Pete's sake, I've...

455
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,600
I've been paged by the hospital. It must be an emergency.

456
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,700
Oh my gosh!

457
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,900
Oh, it's a doctor emergency.

458
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,900
- I'm so sorry.
- I didn't hear anything, doctor.

459
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,200
- I keep my pager on vibrate...
- Oh, do you?

460
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,300
- ...for medical emergencies, yes.
- Uh-huh.

461
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,300
- Thank you so much for having me.
- It was great to meet you.

462
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,900
Aren't you a cosmetic surgeon?

463
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,700
Yes, we have emergencies in that field as well.

464
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,900
You know, it's too bad. Ethel's coming down soon.

465
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,800
She's really gonna be upset that she didn't get to meet you.

466
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
I'll meet her another time, I'm sure. Thank you.

467
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,700
So Marla, I'm sorry I'll see you at home.

468
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,300
- I'll see you at home, honey.
- Thank you, everyone.

469
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,000
- Love you.
- Found it!

470
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
What?

471
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,300
- Stevie!
- He found the matzah!

472
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,200
In a hurry, doctor?

473
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,000
- As I explained, I've been paged by my hospital.
- Yes, I know.

474
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,700
Emergency boob job, no doubt.

475
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,000
I've been paged for a medical emergency

476
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,300
- because I am a doctor.
- Yes yes yes.

477
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,900
You're a doctor. Yes yes, of course, you're a doctor.

478
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,200
- It's a medical situation.
- You're lucky that old lady fainted.

479
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,900
I don't... I don't know what you're talking about.

480
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,400
You took that paper. I know you did.

481
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
I'm a doctor, you idiot!

482
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,200
Good yontif.

483
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,700
- Larry?
- Hey, buddy, what's up?

484
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,500
Can I talk to you for a second?

485
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,500
- Sure, what's up?
- Um... this is really hard.

486
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
I, uh...

487
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,700
I'm... in the throes of a moral quandary right now,

488
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,100
- and I don't know what to do.
- Okay, um...

489
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,700
I'm not really the right...

490
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,500
- I'm not a good person to...
- Oh, I think you are.

491
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,400
- You're the perfect person.
- ...to confide in, no no no.

492
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,600
What you need to see is a doctor or a psychiatrist,

493
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
- a counselor of some kind.
- A doctor, no no no.

494
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,100
I'm... I'm clear on what I'm torn about:

495
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,000
My allegiance to you as a friend,

496
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,400
and not wanting to ruin the party.

497
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,100
Uh, but I saw something very shocking,

498
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,500
and I feel like I have to tell you.

499
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,000
What... what's going on?

500
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,400
Well, I saw Mr. Dunkle whisper in his son's ear

501
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,800
and then the boy went right over and found the matzah.

502
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,500
Oh my god.

503
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,900
Yeah, because he saw me hiding it.

504
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,000
We made eye contact. He saw it.

505
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,500
Well, there you go.

506
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Sorry.

507
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
Okay.

508
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
- I'll take it from here.
- Ok.

509
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,400
When am I gonna get my dollar?

510
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,700
Oh yeah, your dollar.

511
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,700
That's right. Let me ask you a question, Stevie.

512
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,300
I notice that you went to the bookcase once.

513
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,100
What made you go back there a second time?

514
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,600
Hey, look look, he found the matzah, pay up.

515
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,400
I'm just trying to find out why he went back...

516
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,700
There's no need for a third degree.

517
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,300
The boy found the alpha common, just pay him the dollar.

518
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,600
- How come you went back, Stevie?
- Stop it!

519
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,500
He found the matzah, pay up. That's that!

520
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,600
- He found the matzah?
- Yeah!

521
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,800
'Cause you told him where it was hidden.

522
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,700
- That is a lie!
- Didn't you?

523
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,300
- Didn't you?
- That is a lie!

524
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,600
You don't know anything.

525
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,400
- How would you know that?
- How do I know?

526
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,900
How would you know?

527
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,000
My friend told me, that's how I know!

528
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,200
He saw you whisper in your son's ear

529
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,400
and then watched as he ran to the bookcase

530
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,500
- and got the matzah.
- Oh, your friend the convicted sex offender!

531
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,100
Oh my god! Oh my god, there's something wrong with Sammy.

532
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,000
Sammy, Sammy, get up. Come on, come on.

533
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,300
What's the matter, honey? What is it?

534
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,800
She can't breathe. She can't breathe.

535
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
- Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?
- Oh my god!

536
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
I do.
