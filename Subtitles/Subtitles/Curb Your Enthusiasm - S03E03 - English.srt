1
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:19,663
My agent calls, he has
an audition for me for a biker.

2
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,793
- Right.
- So, I'm just psyched,

3
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:24,668
and I get my "Hell's Angels"
jacket on and my leather,

4
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:28,163
and I bust into the room.
And there's 30 actors

5
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,234
with bicycle shorts on...
the spandex ones...

6
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,271
and little gloves,
and I'm just going, "Oh, brutal."

7
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:37,510
- Hi.
- Hi.

8
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:41,510
You remember Brad,
or you... this is Brad.

9
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:44,786
- Hey, Brad.
- Gosh, I didn't even hear you come in.

10
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:47,453
You were laughing hard.
I guess you couldn't hear the door.

11
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:49,985
That was funny.

12
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,760
He was telling me
some bad audition stories.

13
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,098
- It's hard being an actor.
- It is, it is.

14
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:58,764
- It's not too bad.
- No, you seem to be doing all right.

15
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:00,102
Yeah.

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,074
Well... you know,
you guys continue.

17
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,306
I'll go upstairs, no big deal,
and I'll talk to you later.

18
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:08,712
- What are you talking about?
- No, I gotta go, I got an audition.

19
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:10,683
Yeah, no,
I gotta go.

20
00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:12,776
And I will see you Thursday
and we'll do it again.

21
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,616
- Yeah, all right.
- Thanks for the beer.

22
00:01:14,654 --> 00:01:16,451
- Yeah.
- Okay, take it easy.

23
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,923
Bye, Brad.

24
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,085
- See ya.
- Bye.

25
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:25,662
You know, I'm thinking,
maybe I'll go out and get myself

26
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:28,327
a heterosexual single woman
to play golf with.

27
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:30,268
Oh, Larry, are you a little jealous?
What's going on?

28
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:33,170
No, I'm not jealous.
I'm just saying I'm gonna...

29
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:35,333
I can't have a friend?

30
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,536
- You're pretty naive.
- We can't play tennis...?

31
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:40,205
Play tennis, I don't care.
He still wants to sleep with you.

32
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:42,374
He's attracted to you,
and he wants to have sex with you.

33
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,441
- You don't think he does?
- No, I don't think he does.

34
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:46,384
- You don't know anything about men.
- Is that right?

35
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,183
That's right, yeah.

36
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,280
You know what? I wouldn't even
be playing tennis with him

37
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:51,620
if you played tennis with me.

38
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:54,126
You want to play tennis with me?
I'll play tennis with you, fine.

39
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:55,753
Okay.

40
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:57,787
Yeah, call him up,
say you're playing tennis

41
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:59,822
- with me on Thursday.
- All right, I will.

42
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,891
- All right.
- That'll be lovely.

43
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:05,662
Boy, the restaurant's
looking good.

44
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:08,367
- Looks great.
- Yeah, I know, wow.

45
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:10,399
Yeah, three weeks away.
You happy you did it?

46
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:12,844
This is very cool.
I'm glad you talked me into it.

47
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,437
Yeah, how you doing?

48
00:02:15,816 --> 00:02:18,512
Yesterday I get home,
and there's this guy in my living room

49
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:20,952
who plays tennis with my wife.
He's an actor.

50
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:22,978
I said, it's wrong.

51
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:26,254
She's got this, what,
this heterosexual friend?

52
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:29,126
- Why is he at your house?
- Why is he at my house? Exactly.

53
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:30,925
She said, "Then you play
tennis with me."

54
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:32,829
So, I said, "Okay,
I'll play tennis with you."

55
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,128
Now I got to play
tennis with her.

56
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,759
That's better than him
pulling something.

57
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:37,235
- Huh?
- Better than...

58
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,864
- Hey! What the hell?
- Oh, jeez.

59
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:43,137
Is that coffee?
Give me table salt, we've got a spill.

60
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:45,440
Give me a towel.

61
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,913
- Wow.
- All right.

62
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:50,075
What are you doing?

63
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:52,516
This is an old
restaurant trick.

64
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:54,417
You got to dilute
the stain with club soda.

65
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:56,979
Pour club soda
on the stain

66
00:02:57,023 --> 00:03:00,015
and then you
put on table salt.

67
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,756
Club soda
and then salt, huh?

68
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:05,128
- That's gonna get that stain out?
- Um-hmm, um-hmm.

69
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:06,462
Get out of here.
Really?

70
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,559
This has to set a few minutes,
then it'll be fine.

71
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,467
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes.

72
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:11,766
Well, I love that.

73
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:13,898
- Hey, Larry?
- Hey, Randy.

74
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,465
We need to talk.

75
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,308
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

76
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:22,508
Hey, Randy.

77
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:25,416
Hey, Jeff.

78
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:28,580
I'm out, guys.

79
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:31,022
What do you mean,
what are you talking about?

80
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:32,649
- Out? Out of what?
- I can't do this.

81
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:36,719
I can't cook in this restaurant.
I'm no good, I suck.

82
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:38,731
What?
That's ridiculous.

83
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:41,893
- You cooked at my house last week.
- It was delicious.

84
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:44,096
You don't want me.
I'm doing you a big favor, believe me.

85
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,605
What is this about, the peanuts?
Is that what this is about?

86
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,369
That didn't help,
because a lot of cooks...

87
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:50,501
it's frowned on
when they poison someone.

88
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:53,308
- Is it because he asked for ketchup?
- I always have ketchup.

89
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:54,677
- No...
- My mom gave me ketchup.

90
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,909
He loves ketchup, so what?
You can't go by him.

91
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,111
Where's this coming from?
What are you talking about?

92
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:01,120
It's coming
from the pressure.

93
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:03,281
This is going to be
a big celebrity restaurant,

94
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:04,847
I've been reading the publicity.

95
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:06,586
- It's making me nuts, I can't sleep.
- What?!

96
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,787
This place is gonna
get reviewed, you know.

97
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:12,559
You've built this up
in your imagination. This is crazy.

98
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,760
Look, I'm really sorry.
It is not me. Can't do it.

99
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,065
Just... I'm sorry.
Can't.

100
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,208
Hey, Randy.

101
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:24,642
Look, man, I'm sorry,
I'm really sorry.

102
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:26,737
What?

103
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:29,780
Huh.

104
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:31,283
He just quit.

105
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:34,711
Randy just quit?
Wh-why?

106
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:37,348
He was upset, he didn't feel
like he can do it.

107
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,324
He felt inadequate and didn't think
he was a good cook,

108
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,293
and all the pressure
of the restaurant opening...

109
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:44,297
- He doesn't want to be reviewed.
- And all the publicity...

110
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:47,027
- A chef doesn't want to be reviewed?
- Doesn't want to be reviewed.

111
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:49,160
Was it the whole peanut thing?
Is that what upset him?

112
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:51,170
No, we never mentioned
the peanut thing.

113
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:53,832
No, he feels pressure.

114
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:56,671
Do we have any ideas,

115
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,701
like, three weeks away,
what are we gonna do?

116
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:01,771
Find somebody. I don't know anybody,
but we'll find somebody.

117
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:03,908
I don't know anybody, no.

118
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,647
Wait a minute. Josh.
Josh would be great.

119
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:10,622
The guy who cooks for us at home.
He'd be fabulous.

120
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:13,854
If we could
come over and try it.

121
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:15,121
Yeah.

122
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:19,097
Obviously we'd have to come over
and sample it, right?

123
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:21,100
Yeah, come on over
and you can sample it.

124
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:23,261
Oh, yes,
he's a great cook.

125
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:26,136
- You don't want to hold him back, huh?
- No, no.

126
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:28,265
Oh, my God!

127
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:31,140
He got it all out.
The stain's gone.

128
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:33,737
Club soda and salt.

129
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,647
The trick is to get to the stain
before it dries.

130
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:45,024
Whatever happened
to that...

131
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:47,686
that place
for your parents?

132
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:49,558
I'm getting them
that apartment on Barrington.

133
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:51,120
All right.

134
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,798
- Oh...!
- You know what?

135
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,267
I swear to you I'm gonna kill you
when that ball hits me.

136
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:59,465
So, my mother will start
getting that new treatment

137
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:03,306
at Cedars-Sinai and hopefully
she'll get better and they'll go home.

138
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:06,608
Hey, Melanie, Ed.

139
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,614
Hey, how are
you guys doing?

140
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:10,616
Hey, good.
Lawrence.

141
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,345
It's so good to see you.

142
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:13,784
Hi.

143
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,014
- You guys look good.
- Thanks.

144
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:17,387
- Thank you.
- Just playing some tennis.

145
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:19,449
- Playing some tennis, yeah.
- So are we.

146
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:21,392
It's good
to see you guys.

147
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:22,861
Thank you.

148
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:25,228
- All right.
- Yeah, have a good game.

149
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:28,200
- Yes. You too.
- Bye bye.

150
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:31,660
What the hell was that?

151
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:33,900
I don't know.

152
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,636
She was acting like
she doesn't even know me.

153
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:38,701
When was the last time
you called her?

154
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:41,236
I don't know, about
three months ago, maybe?

155
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:42,942
Uh-huh.

156
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:46,383
Oh, my God.

157
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,287
You know, we never
really bought 'em a wedding gift.

158
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:52,314
And it's been over a year.

159
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:55,384
- Yeah, it's over a year.
- How did we forget a wedding gift?

160
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:57,919
We should just
pick something up.

161
00:06:57,964 --> 00:06:59,989
- You know, I don't want...
- Fine, we'll get them...

162
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:02,058
Every time we run into them
I don't want it to be like that.

163
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:05,401
But it's ridiculous to harbor a grudge
because we didn't get a present.

164
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:08,202
We went out of our way
to fly to Chicago to their wedding.

165
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,368
We should pick
something up for them.

166
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,935
Buy 'em a car.

167
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:23,650
You okay?

168
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,498
- Is that good?
- It was out.

169
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,591
- That was out?
- Yeah.

170
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:36,602
If we were playing doubles
it would've been good.

171
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:39,469
You know what?
You gotta stop the grunting.

172
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:41,474
What are you talking about?

173
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:43,738
You grunt on every shot.
Every shot you hit,

174
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:46,746
you, "Ungh! Ungh!"
You make this disgusting noise...

175
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,873
Ungh...!
You don't hear it?

176
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:50,906
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

177
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,214
That's how I play.
I didn't even know I was doing it.

178
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:55,050
You grunt every shot.
It's really annoying

179
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:56,555
and it's throwing me off.

180
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,716
Oh! Is that
why you're losing?

181
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:01,659
It sounds like pigs fucking.

182
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:04,288
How do you like this?
Would you like to listen to this, huh?

183
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,695
Ungh!

184
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:07,723
I don't mind it.

185
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,428
Ungh!

186
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:14,000
All right, that's the game.
And set.

187
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:22,210
I really think I've finally found
the perfect sock.

188
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:23,875
I'm not kidding.

189
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,976
'Cause it's not
exactly white.

190
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:29,284
You don't want a white sock.
It's sort of a...

191
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:31,187
Is this boring you?

192
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:33,385
I don't know.
If you had said to me,

193
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:35,860
"I found a perfect pair of socks,"
I'd go, "No kidding?

194
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:37,886
Where'd you get them?
What are they like?"

195
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,429
So, you know that play,
"Tony and Tina's Wedding"?

196
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,630
I think I might
go on Friday.

197
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:49,742
Oh.

198
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:52,973
- What?
- You don't want me to go with you?

199
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:56,914
I didn't know that you'd want to go.
I'm throwing it out there.

200
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,850
Why wouldn't I
want to go?

201
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:00,750
I enjoy the theater
as much as the next guy.

202
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:03,950
The characters mix in
with the audience.

203
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,890
- So what? I'm fine with that.
- You are?

204
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:08,587
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

205
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:13,797
So how come you want
to go see that?

206
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,425
I've just heard
a lot about it...

207
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:19,404
you know, and Brad's in it.

208
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,634
So...

209
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:26,740
Oh.

210
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,714
What is wrong with you?

211
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:31,717
You're thinking
about going to see

212
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:34,584
"Tony and Tina's Wedding"
on Friday night,

213
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:37,112
and...

214
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:40,455
Brad is in it.

215
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:43,053
I want us to go see
"Tony and Tina's Wedding."

216
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:45,792
- Oh, do you?
- I do.

217
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:47,891
Yeah.
You know what?

218
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:50,027
Go see "Tony and Tina's Wedding."
That's fine.

219
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:51,969
No, I want us to go together.

220
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:54,599
Yeah, I heard
what you said.

221
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:57,508
- It wasn't that hard to figure out...
- I meant "we."

222
00:09:57,543 --> 00:09:59,977
I'll just go see the show
and go home. Don't worry about me.

223
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:02,311
- Oh, no, listen...
- You and Brad can go have some beers.

224
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:04,543
- It's fine. Don't...
- I was saying, "we."

225
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:07,417
- It was the assumed "we."
- There was no assumed "we."

226
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:09,421
- You said "I."
- When I make plans, I think of us.

227
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:11,650
You're reading
things into it.

228
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:14,023
- I don't think I am.
- I think you are.

229
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,221
I think you're completely
reading things into this.

230
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:18,287
I don't think so.
You are so busted.

231
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,391
I am not.
Listen, I want to go with you.

232
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:22,696
No.

233
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:23,929
Don't you want
to go with me?

234
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,768
I don't know. It depends on
what you'll do for it.

235
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:29,468
- I'll do just about anything.
- Is that right?

236
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:31,272
Yeah, yeah.
Do you have a problem with that?

237
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,973
No, I like this.
Getting in trouble,

238
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:36,208
using sex to get out of it...
this is very good.

239
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:38,308
Okay, good, then
we're both happy.

240
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,114
Oh, shit!

241
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:42,621
All right, don't worry about it.
It's cranberry juice.

242
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:44,885
It's not gonna
come out anyway. Come here.

243
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:47,256
Oh, no, no, wait a second,
wait a second, wait a second.

244
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:50,456
I saw this at the restaurant today.
Club soda and salt!

245
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:52,555
Gets the whole
stain out.

246
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:55,624
You know what? It's an old rug.
Don't worry about it.

247
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,260
No, no, no.
Wait till you see this.

248
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:59,931
You're gonna be amazed.
Time's of the essence!

249
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,569
Where's the salt?!

250
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:12,247
- Where's the salt?!
- It's by the stove!

251
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:24,328
I hope I'm not too late.
That's the only thing I hope.

252
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:28,232
I hope I'm not too late.
Club soda, okay?

253
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:32,169
Put the club soda,
use very liberally,

254
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:34,571
do a tap-tap...
I saw him tap-tap.

255
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:37,508
Now the salt,
salt all over.

256
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:40,137
Don't spare the salt.

257
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:43,671
And you are gonna be amazed
at how this works.

258
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:45,684
That's it.
That's all you need to do.

259
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:49,848
And, we've...

260
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:54,292
still got a few minutes
till it dries.

261
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:56,693
Are you out
of your mind?

262
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:59,163
- Why?
- Are you kidding me?

263
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:01,166
Come on, we got a few minutes.
Gonna dry.

264
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,930
I gave you a window of opportunity
that has slammed closed.

265
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,938
What do you mean you gave me
a "window of opportunity"?

266
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:07,371
- Honey...
- What?

267
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:09,398
No.

268
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:16,738
All right.

269
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:21,885
When you get up
tomorrow morning,

270
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:24,913
that stain's
gonna be all gone.

271
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:27,357
You watch.

272
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,264
Hey. Come on in.

273
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:40,329
Hope you're hungry.

274
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:42,841
- How are you, Jeff?
- Good. How are you doing, man?

275
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,843
Good, good, good, good.
You're in for a treat.

276
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:46,708
He's very excited.
Hey, Josh!

277
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:49,544
- What are you talking about?
- He's so excited.

278
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:52,050
Hi, gentlemen.
How are you? I'm Josh.

279
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,053
Larry.

280
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,078
- Yeah, Jeff.
- Jeff, nice to meet you.

281
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:58,090
I just want to thank you
for the opportunity

282
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:00,251
for possibly being your chef
for the new restaurant.

283
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:02,488
I'm gonna run back in
and do some last-minute prep,

284
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:05,224
but I will see you in a bit.
Thank you.

285
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:06,993
- This is gonna be fun.
- What did you do?

286
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:08,466
What do you mean,
what did I do?

287
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,026
Why did you tell him that we were
coming for that purpose?

288
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,630
- What was I supposed to do?
- Tell him, "Friends over for dinner."

289
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:15,470
You didn't have to tell him
the whole thing.

290
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:17,908
- What's the big deal?
- An audition's a lot of pressure.

291
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:20,469
We have three weeks,
that's a lot of pressure. This is not...

292
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:22,845
He's a good cook.
Relax, come enjoy.

293
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:25,908
Come on, seriously.
You're impossible.

294
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,729
Pass the...
salt, please?

295
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:51,844
That's a nice shirt.

296
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:54,073
Yeah, my mom
got it for me.

297
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:55,978
She dropped it off
at the office.

298
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:58,483
What is that?
A velour or something?

299
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:01,715
Don't know.
It's very comfortable.

300
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:04,450
All right, all right,
what do you think? Come on.

301
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,357
- Food? Great!
- Yeah?

302
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:09,623
Yeah, great.
He knows his stuff.

303
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:11,687
- He really does meat well.
- Tender.

304
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:14,791
- You were right, good call.
- Thank you, thank you.

305
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:18,604
What do you think,
Larry?

306
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:19,832
Eh.

307
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:22,568
What do
you mean, "Eh"?

308
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:24,405
Eh.

309
00:14:24,443 --> 00:14:27,571
- You're crazy.
- You walked in with this attitude.

310
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:29,547
- I didn't walk in with any attitude.
- You did too.

311
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:32,016
- Just 'cause I told him before.
- That's bullshit.

312
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:34,918
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

313
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:37,149
- Why do you say that?
- 'Cause you weigh eight pounds.

314
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,248
What do you know about food?

315
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,350
Thin people know more
about food than fat people.

316
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:43,123
I have more food experience
than you, my friend.

317
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:44,595
Let me tell you something, okay?

318
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,564
I never got laid a lot,
but that doesn't mean

319
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,863
the guy who got laid more than me
appreciated it any more.

320
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,892
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

321
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:53,599
A guy who gets laid a lot
knows more about...

322
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,574
He might know more about sex
but he doesn't appreciate it any more.

323
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:58,577
I appreciate it.

324
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:00,579
You know, you are
such a pain in the ass.

325
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,945
All right, fine. What are we gonna do?
What do you want to do?

326
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:07,445
We'll just have to find somebody
who we all agree on.

327
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,454
No, I mean, what do you
want to do about Josh?

328
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,854
He worked his heart out
for this meal.

329
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:14,416
Well, you know, what are we
supposed to do?

330
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,553
We can't hire him
if we don't all agree on it.

331
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:19,656
- All right, fine, you tell him.
- I don't have to tell him.

332
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:21,963
Josh!

333
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:26,337
Gentlemen, how was everything?
Did you enjoy your lamb?

334
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:29,170
- Wonderful.
- It was delicious.

335
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,938
Good. Did you enjoy the plum,
apricot, and mint chutney?

336
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:33,707
The chutney
was amazing.

337
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:36,476
Thank you
very much. Yes?

338
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:38,676
Larry has something
he wants to tell you.

339
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:41,986
Yes, Larry?

340
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:44,990
It was good.

341
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,252
I just don't think it's...

342
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:51,263
quite right
for the restaurant, though.

343
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,788
What was
wrong with it?

344
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:59,530
A little saucy.
A little too saucy.

345
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:01,733
"Saucy"?

346
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:04,004
Yeah, kind of saucy.

347
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:07,103
Was there anything else?

348
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:12,512
Mmm... not really.

349
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:16,482
I guess dessert's
out of the question.

350
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:19,958
- No, I'll still take dessert.
- I'll take dessert too.

351
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,553
Okay.

352
00:16:23,596 --> 00:16:25,564
And you have decaf?

353
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:28,965
I'd love a decaf too.
A little bit of skim milk.

354
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:33,232
- Ted...?
- No.

355
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:36,775
Okay.

356
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,838
What should we get for their
wedding present?

357
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:44,941
I love how these people
take their shopping carts

358
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:49,114
bring 'em home and leave them there.
What is that?

359
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:51,146
So, I was thinking

360
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,522
maybe that store
on Montana Avenue.

361
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,120
You know, I really
don't like not driving.

362
00:16:57,163 --> 00:16:59,131
You should've let me drive.

363
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:01,190
It's my car.

364
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,201
On the way back,
I'm gonna drive.

365
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:04,702
Why?

366
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:07,501
I don't feel I have
a personality in this seat.

367
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,534
No, really.
I feel very... dull.

368
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:14,978
Mm-hmm.

369
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:18,347
You want me to sing,
or you want the radio?

370
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,352
I think I'd rather
the radio.

371
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:21,580
All right.

372
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:26,350
- What is this, a tape?
- Um-hmm.

373
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:30,123
What are you doing with a tape?
I thought you only buy CDs.

374
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:32,357
Actually, a friend
loaned it to me.

375
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:35,458
Who is this?

376
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:37,492
It's Al Green.

377
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:39,401
Who gave you
this tape?

378
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,633
Brad.

379
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:43,699
It's good, isn't it?

380
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:45,870
You oughta be with me...

381
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:48,709
"You oughta be with me"?
Is that what he's saying?

382
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:51,979
- You oughta be with me
- "You oughta be with me."

383
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:54,508
That's what he's singing about?

384
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:57,750
What is wrong with you?

385
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,258
Wait, Brad gives you a tape?
An Al Green tape...

386
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,453
"You oughta be with me"?

387
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:04,986
You know what,
I don't know...

388
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,396
I swear to God, this thing
gets worse every time.

389
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,924
No, listen...

390
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:12,836
Every day, this story is getting
worse and worse and worse.

391
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:19,845
All right.

392
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:22,279
What about
a nice bowl, huh?

393
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:24,578
You know what?
They've probably got tons of bowls.

394
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:26,676
I'm sure they were
registered somewhere.

395
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:29,620
Everybody likes a good bowl
for cereal and...

396
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:31,520
I feel like I'm not gonna
find anything in here.

397
00:18:31,557 --> 00:18:33,616
Because they probably
have all this stuff, right?

398
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:37,288
- Dishes and stemware...
- There's not much in here.

399
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:39,820
Why don't we just get them
a nice piece of fish?

400
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:42,925
We should just go next door
to that wine shop

401
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,732
and get an expensive
bottle of wine. Let's do that.

402
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:49,502
- How expensive?
- 200, 250?

403
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,840
I don't know.
It's got to be a good one,

404
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:54,402
- they'll know the difference.
- Oh, of course they will.

405
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:56,540
All right,
are you coming?

406
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:59,449
What, between this
and a wine store? No, I'll stay here.

407
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:01,316
All right,
I'll be right back.

408
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:03,321
Okay.

409
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:10,220
Hi. What can I
help you find?

410
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:12,594
Oh, nothing, you know,
I'm just browsing.

411
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:15,031
Yeah, you got that
"bewildered" look.

412
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,592
I know it's a lot to take in.
We'll just...

413
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:20,036
- No, I'm okay.
- If we narrow it down...

414
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:22,302
You know what?
I appreciate it.

415
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:25,469
I'm not really shopping.
I'm kind of browsing.

416
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,479
If I need help,
I'll let you know.

417
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:29,879
- Oh, take your time.
- Okay, thank you.

418
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,314
Oh, all the napkin rings
in the store are 10% off.

419
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:39,381
Just this week.
Not just these,

420
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:41,450
there's a million more.
They're all 10% off.

421
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:43,394
- Okay.
- They make such great gifts.

422
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:45,920
Oh, we have... come here
for a second. Let me show...

423
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:48,433
You know what? I'm really
not interested in buying anything.

424
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:50,298
But thank you.

425
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:53,100
If you're looking in the...
something more affordable,

426
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:56,335
- we have smaller items.
- It's not that. I'm just not looking.

427
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,275
I'm not interested,
but thank you.

428
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,210
Okay.

429
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:04,372
Flatware is always great.

430
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,146
All right, look. Can you stop
following me around, please?

431
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:09,484
I'm not interested
in buying anything.

432
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:11,615
Stop following me.

433
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:14,285
I don't really understand
what's giving you that idea.

434
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,419
Are you... maybe you're paranoid.

435
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:18,657
You've done a complete circle
with me now in the store.

436
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:21,461
Why are you here if you're
not interested in buying anything?

437
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,990
You've never heard
of browsers?

438
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:25,731
Is that word unfamiliar
to you, a browser?

439
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,535
- Please leave.
- You got it.

440
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:31,634
- Thank you. Have a great day.
- I'm well on the way.

441
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:39,109
You know what?
We should drop this off at the Loebs'.

442
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:41,984
You know, we're
in the neighborhood.

443
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:44,546
- $300.
- I know.

444
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,490
- So ridiculous.
- But it's a good one.

445
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,154
Hello?

446
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:51,219
Hey, Cheryl. Brad.

447
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:53,754
- Hi, Brad.
- Hey, what's up?

448
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,393
Nothing.
Larry's in the car.

449
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:58,596
Oh, hey, hey, Larry.

450
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:00,764
- Hey, Brad.
- How you doing?

451
00:21:00,806 --> 00:21:02,296
Pretty good.

452
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:04,571
Hey, Cheryl, still coming
to "Tony and Tina's Wedding"?

453
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,840
- Yeah.
- Hey, I'm going too, Brad.

454
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:08,847
Oh, okay, great.

455
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:11,372
Hey Larry,
still looking for a chef?

456
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:14,079
Actually, I am.

457
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,110
Well, my friend, Paul
is the chef at Alsace

458
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:17,884
and he's thinking about leaving.

459
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:20,323
I know that place, Alsace.
That's a good restaurant.

460
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,884
- Yeah.
- Hey, you know what?

461
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:24,759
Why don't we go eat there
after the show,

462
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,697
and you can
check out the food?

463
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:28,495
Okay, that sounds
pretty good.

464
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:31,526
All right, well...
hey, I'll see you at the show.

465
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,232
- Okay, bye.
- Take it easy, Cheryl.

466
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:39,411
"Larry's in the car."

467
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:41,879
What?

468
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:46,408
"Larry's in the car.
If you plan on doing any dirty-talking,

469
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:48,420
better save it for another time

470
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:50,615
because Larry's in the car."

471
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:54,490
I was letting him know, to be polite.
When you're on speakerphone,

472
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:56,289
you're supposed
to let people know...

473
00:21:56,328 --> 00:21:59,161
- Yes. Yeah. Uh-huh.
...who's listening.

474
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:00,859
I mean, I think that
you would be excited.

475
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:02,389
He might have found a chef.

476
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:04,299
I actually am.
I think that could be good.

477
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:07,169
I'll call Ted and Jeff
and set it up.

478
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:08,537
Okay.

479
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:12,505
What is this?
Oh, my God.

480
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:16,344
Oh, shit, there's a cop,
what do we do?

481
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:18,816
Just pull over, Larry.

482
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:22,582
Oh, here we go,
Jesus Christ.

483
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,588
What did you do?

484
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:30,094
Let me see your
driver's license, sir.

485
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:32,723
- Can I ask what I did?
- Sure can.

486
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:35,165
Sir, we had a report from a young lady
on her cell phone

487
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,259
saying you've been
following her in your car.

488
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:39,463
Following someone, what?

489
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:41,473
I'm going to drop off
a bottle of wine.

490
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:43,532
It's a friend's house
in Moreno.

491
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:45,600
- Okay, well, we did have...
- This is the guy.

492
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:48,238
I can't believe
you were doing this.

493
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,805
This guy came into
the store where I work

494
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:53,374
and accused me
of following him around,

495
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,717
and then had, like,
a little freak-out fit.

496
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:58,587
- Now he's following me.
- I don't know what she's talking about.

497
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:00,353
You're turning left
when I'm turning left,

498
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:01,984
turning right
when I'm turning right.

499
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:03,858
This is, like,
your sick revenge?

500
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:05,830
You follow me around
and scare me like that?

501
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:08,094
- This is just so idiotic.
- What is wrong with you?

502
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:10,260
Would you explain to me why
you've been following this lady?

503
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:11,997
I'm not following her.
I was in a store,

504
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:14,335
- and she was following me.
- I heard that part, I understand.

505
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:16,398
- I was not following him.
- You don't even know

506
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:18,603
how to work in a store.
People ask you to leave them alone,

507
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:20,134
and you harass them!

508
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:23,444
- First of all, I was not following you!
- You were so following me!

509
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:25,473
I was not following you,
I work there.

510
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:27,849
We're in a residential
neighborhood here, please.

511
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:29,854
- When my husband finds out about this,
- Ma'am, go back to your car.

512
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:31,788
- there's gonna be a problem.
- I'm worried about your husband.

513
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:33,223
You know what?
You are.

514
00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:35,658
Sir, why don't you stay
in your car for a moment?

515
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:37,491
I'll be right back with you.

516
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:45,136
Maybe we should've
called first.

517
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,400
We're right in the neighborhood.
What's the difference?

518
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,804
But do you drop by
somebody's house?

519
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:51,332
Sure. You got a gift,
you drop by.

520
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:53,344
- Hey, Melanie.
- Hello.

521
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,812
- Hi. What's going on?
- Hey, Ed!

522
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:57,839
- Hi.
- We were just in the neighborhood.

523
00:23:57,883 --> 00:24:01,512
And thought we'd drop off
your wedding gift.

524
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:03,384
I'm sorry it's late,
congratulations.

525
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:05,219
We can't take your wedding...
are you serious?

526
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:07,623
- No.
- We can't take a wedding gift now.

527
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,786
We got married 14 months ago.

528
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:13,429
You can't give a gift
after a year, you know that.

529
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:15,831
I know, that's why
I'm sorry.

530
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:18,336
You can't give a gift after a year?
What happens after a year?

531
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,964
- You can't give it. That's the cut-off.
- You can't give it?

532
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:22,667
You can give it
with an apology.

533
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,233
This is a beautiful bottle of wine.

534
00:24:25,277 --> 00:24:27,575
- We can't take it!
- It's an afterthought, and it's late.

535
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:30,878
We just spent $300
on this bottle of wine for you

536
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,077
and you're not accepting it?!
Is that what you're saying?

537
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:35,416
We can't take the gift
after a year.

538
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:37,945
You had no problem taking
the $200 engagement vase we got you.

539
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,288
You had no problem with the shower gift.
What'd you get her?

540
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:42,259
- The nightgown.
- The nightgown, that was okay.

541
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:45,991
Then we flew to Chicago
for your little wedding bash.

542
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:49,228
You're into us now
for about $5,500, as I see it.

543
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:51,236
First of all, it was not
a "little wedding."

544
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,261
We had 266 people there.

545
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:56,138
- Then why did you come?
- Because she put a gun to my head,

546
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:58,973
- that's why!
- I don't believe that.

547
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:02,139
- You came 'cause you wanted to come.
- I was desperate to go to your wedding.

548
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,342
If it was too expensive,
you shouldn't have come, Larry.

549
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:06,578
And I'm sorry that you
can't accept a gift

550
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:09,485
- after 12 months, but you just can't.
- It's the way things are.

551
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:12,490
They don't want the wine.
We're past the cut-off, we're sorry.

552
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:15,493
You would do the same thing.
I know you would do the same.

553
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:17,586
By the way, do you
have anybody in there

554
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:19,290
to clean up the mess
I'm about to make?

555
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:21,322
- No, no, no.
- Now you're being silly.

556
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:24,335
- Thank you!
- Next time call.

557
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:30,369
You know what
I was just thinking,

558
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:32,138
maybe you should've
worn a sports coat.

559
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:34,168
You think so? That's true.
Everybody's wearing...

560
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:36,204
well, he's not
wearing a sport jacket.

561
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:39,649
He might be an actor.
That might be part of his character.

562
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:41,175
Oh.

563
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,586
That's what happens...
the actors mingle.

564
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:46,022
All right, I'm gonna
go use the bathroom.

565
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:48,390
Okay, I'll grab a pew.

566
00:25:53,732 --> 00:25:56,326
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Angelo.

567
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:58,268
Antola,
Angelo Antola.

568
00:25:58,303 --> 00:25:59,327
Hi, Brad.

569
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:00,668
Brad?

570
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:04,904
Hey, so, you with Tony's side
or Tina's side?

571
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:08,902
Brad, you know,
cut the shit, okay?

572
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:11,882
Shit? Brad? I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

573
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:14,408
- I'm on Tina's side.
- Oh, are you?

574
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:16,751
Yeah, yeah, me and Tina,
we're close.

575
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,187
It's a shame she's
gonna marry that jerk.

576
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:24,889
Only doing it for the money.
She don't love him.

577
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,421
She doesn't love him.

578
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:30,060
But me and Tina,
that's a different story.

579
00:26:30,102 --> 00:26:34,038
- We got something special, me and her.
- Oh, do you?

580
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:36,370
Between the two of us,
no one would understand, really.

581
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:38,603
Yeah, well, you're
a very complex person.

582
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:41,306
Thank you. We have a better
understanding of things

583
00:26:41,346 --> 00:26:43,439
than that cocksucker.

584
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:47,543
- That cocksucker, Tony.
- Yeah, that cocksucker.

585
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:49,520
Yeah, he's a cocksucker, Tony.

586
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:53,456
Yeah, one day, me and Tina,
we'll end up together,

587
00:26:53,492 --> 00:26:55,460
'cause this will never work.

588
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:57,359
- Yeah, you think so?
- Oh, yeah.

589
00:26:57,396 --> 00:27:00,024
Then I'll finally
slip her the "sausage."

590
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:01,555
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

591
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,761
That very formidable
sausage of yours.

592
00:27:03,802 --> 00:27:06,737
And she will be
forever grateful, my friend.

593
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:09,832
Yeah, it's been fun doing this little
improv with you.

594
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,809
Improv, whatever you
want to call it.

595
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:13,174
I'll see you later
at the restaurant.

596
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:15,076
At the reception,
you bet, you bet.

597
00:27:15,113 --> 00:27:16,603
I'll swing by, I'll say hello.

598
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:18,616
Yeah, well, good,
that's good, okay, yeah.

599
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,380
- Hey, that's not bad.
- You swing by.

600
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,786
I'll see you later, okay?
I'll see you later.

601
00:27:23,822 --> 00:27:26,586
Okay.

602
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:31,218
You guys missed a great show.
You should check it out.

603
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:33,254
- Don't you think?
- Yeah, it was really good.

604
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:36,096
- Brad was great, by the way.
- Thank you.

605
00:27:36,134 --> 00:27:38,967
Hey, Larry, some guy named Angelo
keeps looking for you.

606
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:41,472
He was doing some shtick
in the bathroom.

607
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:44,202
Nothing funnier than shtick
in the bathroom.

608
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:46,870
It was good, it was good.
You should check it out.

609
00:27:46,912 --> 00:27:48,743
- I'm hungry, shall we do this?
- I'm starving.

610
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,078
I'll tell you what, we should order
everything on the menu.

611
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:52,879
- All right.
- The chef's name's Paul?

612
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:55,580
- Paul.
- Chef Paul.

613
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,145
Want to get some wine?
Something? I'm thirsty.

614
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,680
I know this
seems crazy but...

615
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:01,352
Oh, I didn't know you
brought the wine.

616
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:03,054
I know,
it was a surprise.

617
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:05,120
Excuse me, could you
open this wine for us?

618
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:07,188
- Well, sure.
- Thank you.

619
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:08,824
Oh, wait till you
hear this story.

620
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,835
So, we had these
friends that got married...

621
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:13,337
They didn't take it?

622
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:15,966
So, they didn't take it,
and Larry started shouting.

623
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:17,771
- And I just grabbed it...
- Look at that.

624
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:19,572
They actually
didn't accept the gift.

625
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:21,442
I've never heard
of anything so crazy.

626
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,607
- It was crazy.
- $300 bottle of wine, we win.

627
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:27,277
- Here's to the Loebs.
- Yeah, to the Loebs.

628
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,380
Hey, what's your problem?!
What is your problem?

629
00:28:31,423 --> 00:28:33,687
Cheryl, don't move.
I've got it under control.

630
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:35,818
I need club soda
and salt.

631
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:38,489
Hey, you, turn around,
look at her, right there.

632
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,191
- Is this the guy? That's him?
- Yes.

633
00:28:40,232 --> 00:28:42,291
- You were following my wife?
- I wasn't following her.

634
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:44,598
She called the cops on you.
Look at me.

635
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:46,365
I need salt,
I need salt.

636
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:49,772
I'm talking to you. I said look at me!
She was scared half to death,

637
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:52,106
and you're some kind of pervert
following her in the store?!

638
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:54,203
I'll take you outside...
look at me!

639
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:56,305
I will kick your ass
right now!
