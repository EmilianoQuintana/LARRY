0
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:18,240
There.
There we go, Larry.

1
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,876
Let me get this
cotton out for you

2
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,819
and you'll be ready
for Dr. Funkhouser.

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,786
Thank you,
Delilah.

4
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,128
- Hey, Saul.
- How you doing? Feeling all right?

5
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,795
- How are you?
- Uh, lost a crown.

6
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:40,169
Sorry about last time.
You're not gonna throw up this time.

7
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,867
- I swear.
- I hope not.

8
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,069
Why didn't you tell me
that you're allergic?

9
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,137
- I can't do the gas. It makes me sick.
- Go "ah."

10
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,082
- What's this?
- We have to do this. It's insurance.

11
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,517
- Open up.
- You're taking a picture of my mouth?

12
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:57,148
Wide, open up wide.
That's very, very angry and red today.

13
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,125
But I think
it's gonna be fine.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,185
By the way, it was very
nice of you to RSVP

15
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,889
for my uncle Leo's
testimonial.

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,057
How could I miss
his testimonial?

17
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,067
I've got people
coming from Russia.

18
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,035
- Really?
- A cousin coming from Russia.

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,664
I don't see him playing golf anymore.
Does he still play?

20
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,265
- My uncle Leo, he's no spring chicken.
- Yeah, I know.

21
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,139
Sometimes he's feeling
like he could do it,

22
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,702
and sometimes he doesn't want
to embarrass himself.

23
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,112
- Roll up and we'll do this.
- What's going on here?

24
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,675
It's a little sedative. You can't
take the gas, this is the alternative.

25
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,913
Roll up the sleeve
and we'll do it.

26
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,320
Come on, come on, come on.
You afraid of the needle?

27
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,221
No, you know what?

28
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,453
I'm just concerned
that if I roll it up,

29
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,587
it's gonna lose
its elasticity.

30
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,722
You see how it kind of
clings to the wrist now?

31
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,201
They call it an elastic cuff
for a reason, 'cause it snaps back.

32
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,227
You'd think it would, but it's
not like a sock. A sock snaps back.

33
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,136
You can wear a sock
500 times with no problem.

34
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,266
No, socks are cheap,
they don't snap back.

35
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,402
- It takes more than once...
- Believe me,

36
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,605
on very few subjects
I'm a expert on,

37
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,113
and I'm an expert
on elastic.

38
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,945
All right,
you know what, Larry?

39
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,451
If you're that concerned about it,
just take it off.

40
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,283
- Then you don't have to worry about it.
- Okay.

41
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,721
Excuse me, Mr. Sherman
is on the phone.

42
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,247
- Talk to him. I'm with a patient.
- He needs to talk to you.

43
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,692
- Why?
- Root canal. He's called three times.

44
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,526
Okay, fine. You know what?
We're gonna roll this right up

45
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,727
- because I haven't got the time.
- I was gonna take it off.

46
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:18,601
I have people with real problems
in there and I have to do this now.

47
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,367
I have an hysteric
on the phone,

48
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,998
I have people
in the waiting room,

49
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,441
and this is enough already!
It's enough.

50
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,344
Know what I'm saying?
Five minutes, you're gonna feel fine.

51
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,109
- What line is it?
- Line one.

52
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,982
Oh, great. Look, he ruined the shirt.
Look at this cuff.

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,454
And it's flopping all over the place.
Look at that.

54
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,289
- What's with him?
- He's not himself right now.

55
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,817
His uncle
has Hodgkin's.

56
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,695
Yeah, but it's
the good Hodgkin's.

57
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,723
I didn't know there
was a good Hodgkin's.

58
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:52,261
I'm not saying it's a great Hodgkin's.
It's a good Hodgkin's.

59
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,345
- I'll get it.
- Hey, Pop.

60
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,213
- Mmm?
- Do me a favor, okay?

61
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,217
Next time you use
the bathroom,

62
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,242
make sure to keep
the seat down.

63
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,482
What are you,
pussy-whipped?

64
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,685
It's not really about her,
it's about me.

65
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,593
- I pee sitting down.
- How long you been doing that?

66
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,258
Well, it started because I was
getting up to go at night sometimes

67
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,394
and I didn't feel like
putting the light on,

68
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,030
so I would sit down,
and then I, you know,

69
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,835
I got very comfortable
with it.

70
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,842
Comfortable with...
a man doesn't do that.

71
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,003
- A man stands up to pee.
- I like to sit down,

72
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,910
and I don't want to wind up
in the toilet

73
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,313
because you're keeping the seat up.
Keep it down.

74
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,614
You stand like a person.
I'm very upset with this. This is crazy.

75
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,586
You know what
Winston Churchill said?

76
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,613
Why stand when you can sit?
Have you ever heard that expression?

77
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,421
No, I never heard that.
But I don't think he meant the toilet.

78
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,725
Do you want me to get those
glaucoma drops for you at the drugstore?

79
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,458
Yes, I'm just about
out of them.

80
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,228
- Pick up the drops for me. Thank you.
- Okay.

81
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,601
Larry, so that
was Susie.

82
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,266
Um, they're having
a dinner party on Friday.

83
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,935
Because of the Funkhouser
testimonial,

84
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,707
they're having a little,
you know, dinner party

85
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,943
with Marty Funkhouser
and Ann and they have their cousins

86
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,110
coming in
from Russia, so...

87
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,016
And Ted Danson will
be there with Mary.

88
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:17,511
Oh, okay.
Ted asked us to take care of his dog.

89
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,424
They're going out of town
for a couple of days, so I said okay.

90
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,691
- Us?
- Oh, you're not gonna do anything?

91
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,891
It's just gonna be me?
Okay, fine.

92
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,959
- I like dogs, I'm very happy to do it.
- Okay, you do that.

93
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,563
Look what this dentist
did to my shirt today.

94
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,267
- What happened? It's all stretched out.
- Yeah, I know.

95
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,713
No matter where I sit at these
dinner parties, it always seems

96
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:44,114
like every conversation is more interesting
than the one I've having.

97
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,984
Right. Except when you're
sitting next to me.

98
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,955
No, it still
feels that way.

99
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,116
What are you doing?
what have you got, the mail?

100
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,092
Yeah, I grabbed it
on the way out.

101
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,654
Oh, a bill from
Dr. Funkhouser.

102
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,564
- Already?
- Wonder if Saul's gonna be there?

103
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,693
He didn't mention anything about it.
I just saw him.

104
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,135
I can't believe he already sent a bill.
That was fast.

105
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,900
He needs his money.

106
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,299
Eeew, aaah!

107
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,504
- Oh!
- Oh my God.

108
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:16,777
- What are you, crazy? What's going on?
- What is that?

109
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,047
"Here's a copy of the picture
of your tooth for insurance purposes"?

110
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,179
- My tooth? That's my tooth?
- Oh my God!

111
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,019
- That's in your mouth?!
- What are they sending it to me for?

112
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,891
Why didn't they send it to the insurance
company? I don't need that!

113
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,827
My God!

114
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,359
This is great. You came from Russia
for your uncle's testimonial?

115
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,071
- His favorite uncle.
- Favorite uncle, huh?

116
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,479
It's nice. You get to see
your cousin Marty, right?

117
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,949
He loves Marty.

118
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,645
I like talking
through a translator.

119
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,319
It's fun, yeah.

120
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,552
I wish I could do
this with my wife.

121
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,096
What's with the bare feet?

122
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,936
It's more comfortable this way.
Feels like at home.

123
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,439
Oh, yeah?

124
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,940
Where did... where do you...
where do you buy your glasses,

125
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,775
- in France?
- Los Angeles.

126
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,578
- Can he try it on?
- You know what?

127
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,916
I don't really like people
trying my glasses on.

128
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,782
- Just for one minute.
- I'd rather not.

129
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,792
I'm a little
uncomfortable with it.

130
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,092
- He's a guest here, so, like...
- I understand,

131
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,499
but that doesn't mean I need him
to try on my glass... no, no, nyet!

132
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,063
No!

133
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,504
What are you doing?
No! Nyet!

134
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,143
Okay.

135
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,446
This Russian is nuts.

136
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,383
He just grabbed
for my glasses.

137
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,650
- Out of nowhere?
- He wanted to try them on.

138
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,485
I said I don't like when
people try my glasses on.

139
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:08,426
- He just grabbed for them?
- Yeah. And what's with the no shoes?

140
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,396
Great, I have to have dinner and look
at his disgusting feet all night?

141
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,298
They'll be
under the table.

142
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,860
- Where's Ted and Mary?
- Movie premiere. They couldn't make it.

143
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:21,340
Oh, too bad, too bad.
It would've been nice to have him here.

144
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,001
Instead of all
these Funkhousers.

145
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,703
Yeah, it's chock
full of Funkhousers.

146
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,439
Jeffrey, I need
you in the kitchen, honey.

147
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,348
Oskie, come here, boy.
Come here, boy. Yeah.

148
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:40,155
Who's a good boy?
Yeah, he's a good boy.

149
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,390
Oh, what a good boy.

150
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,262
Yeah, good boy.

151
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,460
Enjoying the dog?

152
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,734
Dinner's served.

153
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,466
And he's gonna
take care of Ted's dog.

154
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,879
Very good.

155
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,714
You can stay up
till 10:00, young lady.

156
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,413
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Sammi.

157
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,059
Maybe you should
take your shoes off like that guy.

158
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,825
Take my shoes off like that guy?
I don't think so.

159
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,562
- You could be twins.
- I don't want to be twins with him.

160
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,798
Oh, no, come on, Sammi.
What are you doing?

161
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,297
Sammi, Sammi, come on!
Give me that sneaker. Sammi!

162
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,744
Hey, Lar, you ever hear
of Denta Friend?

163
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,475
- Denta Friend? No.
- It's a new sonic toothbrush

164
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,484
that would really
get rid of your plaque.

165
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:43,285
What are you talking about, get rid
of my plaque? I don't have plaque.

166
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,222
My cousin's hygienist
told me you had plaque.

167
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,160
Your cousin's hygienist
told you I have a lot of plaque?

168
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,826
What's the big deal?
Plaque is not a serious disease.

169
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,802
First of all, number one,
I don't have any plaque.

170
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,966
Number two, she shouldn't
be talking about it.

171
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,738
That's a breach
of patient/hygienist confidentiality.

172
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,541
There is no patient/hygienist
confidentiality.

173
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,777
- You're so wrong.
- It's unethical. Maybe not legally

174
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,081
like a doctor or a lawyer,
but it's unethical is what he's saying.

175
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,645
It's totally unethical.
And I don't have any plaque.

176
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,021
- Do I have an electric toothbrush?
- He has.

177
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,253
- How often do I floss?
- At least twice a day.

178
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,785
Tell him I don't have any plaque.
Did you tell him that?

179
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,026
- You have plaque.
- You want to have a plaque contest?

180
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,364
- Anytime you want.
- Anytime you want.

181
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,768
- Let's have a plaque contest.
- Fine, you want to?

182
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,931
Challenge me, just
like you do in golf.

183
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,636
By the way, that tip... remember the tip I
gave you at Ben Stiller's house?

184
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,474
- Have you tried it?
- Best tip I ever got.

185
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,980
- Fantastic tip?
- Hold it, hold it.

186
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,380
I've got a tip that will
save your game. Change it.

187
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,908
It's the easiest thing...
the weatherman gave it to me.

188
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,682
Weatherman gave you
a good golf tip?

189
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,656
I played with him two weeks ago
and it's changed my entire game.

190
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,125
- And it is so simple.
- Really? What is it?

191
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,220
- Lock your hands... this way.
- Which? Okay.

192
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,198
- Instead of bringing your
hands back like this... - Right.

193
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,665
You start the rotation...

194
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,864
Sammi!
Sammi!

195
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,701
What is it?
What? What?

196
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,640
What is that? What is this?
Oh, it's disgusting.

197
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,700
- What the hell is this?
- Hey, wait a second.

198
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,975
- What is...
- That's a picture of my tooth.

199
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,313
- The dentist took it for insurance.
- Where did you get that?

200
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,616
- It just fell out of Larry's jacket.
- Fell out of my jacket?

201
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,622
What are you leaving
stuff out like that for?

202
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,851
What are you bringing that
into a person's house for?

203
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,756
She took the mail
into my car.

204
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,762
- Why would you bring it in their house?
- Disgusting, Larry.

205
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,162
- She went through my pocket.
- You know what?

206
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,463
I think we're gonna leave.
We had a great time.

207
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,765
- Thank you very much.
- I'm sorry about this.

208
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,897
- See you at the testimonial.
- I was getting a crown.

209
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,967
- That's all, and...
- Goodbye. Thanks.

210
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,876
She shouldn't have been
going through the papers.

211
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,040
- It's disgusting.
- It is disgusting, believe me.

212
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,344
I think we're gonna leave.

213
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,876
- I'm not feeling very well.
- What, you're not well?

214
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,478
- No, I had too much cake.
- Oh.

215
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,786
Oh, um, I need my...

216
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,314
uh, my sneaker.

217
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,328
- Larry, now is not the time, okay?
- Okay.

218
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,296
You can go home
without your sneaker.

219
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,923
You have more
sneakers at home.

220
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,332
- Your sock might get dirty.
- Sammi, where's my...

221
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,892
Larry!

222
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,929
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

223
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,136
She could have told me
where the sneaker was.

224
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,770
It's not that hard.

225
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,715
"In the closet,"
three words.

226
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,447
One word..."closet."
How about that?

227
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,421
And how about
that hygienist?

228
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,186
It's like, if you go
to a prostitute

229
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:36,626
and the prostitute goes around
telling everybody you got a small penis.

230
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,597
Not that I've ever
been to a prostitute.

231
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,965
Not that I have
a small penis.

232
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,335
You plunk down
$300 for a hooker,

233
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,000
expect her to keep
her mouth shut.

234
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:54,077
I'm only guessing $300.
What do I know? What?

235
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,206
My stomach
is killing me.

236
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,842
I am never gonna eat
at their house again.

237
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,445
I swear, I don't know what Susie
does when she cooks, but it's awful.

238
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,683
Yeah, it was really
pretty bad, wasn't it?

239
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,248
Oh my God,
it was so bad.

240
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,760
I was trying to make
myself throw up.

241
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:12,093
- That's how bad it is.
- Oh, God, poor thing.

242
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,395
Oh, just feel
like I need...

243
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,298
Oh, quiet quiet.
The weatherman's on.

244
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,803
By the beaches it is
a bit cool, around 70°.

245
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,103
But tomorrow's forecast, folks,
I'm sorry to say it, it is rain.

246
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,008
thundershowers, the big ones,
folks, all day.

247
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,877
So for you golfers out there,
better find something else to do.

248
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,881
I know I'll be watching that "Godfather"
trilogy.

249
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,815
Jennifer, Stu, back to you.

250
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,953
- Hello?
- Hey.

251
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,924
- You listening to this?
- Yeah, I just saw it. Listen...

252
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,722
- I'm not gonna play.
- What?

253
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,661
Come on,
it's gonna rain.

254
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,823
He's only saying it's gonna.
We don't know for sure.

255
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,527
He's only saying?
It's his job. It's gonna rain.

256
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,730
Let's wake up in the morning and
at least talk on the phone and see...

257
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,796
No, I'm gonna
stay home with Sammi.

258
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,774
- What?
- No, she's having a tough night

259
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,299
and I just think
it'd be better

260
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,005
if I stayed home
with her tomorrow.

261
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:03,139
He's not right
all the time, you know?

262
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,013
Well, he's right
most of the time.

263
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,985
- And it's gonna rain tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

264
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,783
- Bye.
- Bye.

265
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,067
What?!

266
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,012
What happened,
Larry?

267
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,538
I fell in
the toilet.

268
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,744
Did you leave
the seat up?

269
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,948
Oh, I guess I did
when I tried to throw up.

270
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,013
Oh, I'm sorry.

271
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,651
Oh, you gotta keep
the seat down, Cheryl!

272
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:51,254
Is that too much to ask,
to keep a seat down?!

273
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,231
Soaking wet.

274
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,799
I hurt my back.
Soaking wet.

275
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,767
What's wrong?

276
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,405
My back, oh.

277
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,776
What a lousy
night's sleep.

278
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,286
Man! Cheryl,

279
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,020
it's beautiful out.

280
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:27,531
Jeff canceled golf because
the weatherman predicted rain.

281
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,868
Well, sometimes
they're wrong, Larry.

282
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,532
Predicts rain,
doesn't rain.

283
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,564
It's not the first time
this has happened.

284
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,840
Cheryl, something
fishy's going on here.

285
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,404
What if the weatherman...

286
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,813
predicts
it's gonna rain

287
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,014
just so he can keep people off
the golf course

288
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,989
and have it for himself?
What do you think of that theory?

289
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,584
- I think it's ridiculous.
- Really? Do you?

290
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,390
Mm-hmm.

291
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,862
Something about that
weatherman I don't trust.

292
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,559
I don't like
that weatherman.

293
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,193
He's a very
slick weatherman.

294
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,830
Sounds like you're
really onto something.

295
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,364
I'm gonna go to
that golf course.

296
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,673
I want to check
something out.

297
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,303
Get my cane.

298
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,145
Oh, brother.

299
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,158
Hey, Chuck.

300
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,184
Hey, how's it going,
Larry?

301
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,697
Not bad.
How's it looking out there?

302
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,189
It's wide open, man.
Hardly anybody out there.

303
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,169
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

304
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,661
Probably has something to do
with that weather forecast.

305
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,302
You know what?
Probably does.

306
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,109
Huh.

307
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,208
- Have you seen the weatherman?
- Yes, matter of fact,

308
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,584
there he is with Dr. Funkhouser,
coming up on the ninth hole.

309
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,986
What do you know?

310
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,991
So, uh, what's
with the cane?

311
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,856
Fell in the toilet.

312
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,271
- Hey, Lar.
- Hey, Larry. What's going on?

313
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,297
- Beautiful day, huh?
- Yeah, great day for golf.

314
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,810
- What's up?
- I was supposed to play today.

315
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:22,143
- Really?
- Then Jeff called me and canceled

316
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,741
because of your weather
report about thundershowers.

317
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,752
- He made a mistake, so what?
- I said thundershowers?

318
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,687
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oops.

319
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,283
- Oop.
- Okay, nice to see you.

320
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,419
- Too bad for me. Too bad for me.
- Take care.

321
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,930
I don't quite
get your point.

322
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,558
All right, weatherman,
I'm gonna tell you my point.

323
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,592
I've got
a sneaking suspicion

324
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,366
that you're
predicting rain

325
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,271
to clear the golf course
for yourself.

326
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,869
- Oh my God, come on.
- That's ridiculous.

327
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,606
Ridiculous?
Ridiculous?

328
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,944
It's happened before, weatherman.
You know it.

329
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,542
You know what?
I'm calling the weather people on you.

330
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,019
You're gonna report me
because it's a nice day?

331
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:05,581
I'm gonna report you because every time
you want to play golf,

332
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,149
- you make sure that it's raining.
- First of all,

333
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,252
I'm not a weatherman,
I'm a meteorologist.

334
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,389
- I'd appreciate a little respect.
- Oh, excuse me, Doctor.

335
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,060
Can you guys just calm down?
We're in the middle of a game.

336
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,466
- Larry?
- Yes.

337
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,971
There's a low pressure system
sitting out over the coast.

338
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,734
The jet stream brings
that into this area.

339
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,800
The jet stream is controlled
by the rotation of the earth.

340
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,903
- You know who controls that? God.
- There's a jet stream

341
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,107
of bullshit coming
out of your mouth.

342
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,209
- You are busted, buddy.
- Stop pointing with the cane.

343
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,345
You're busted!
Yeah, Dr. Funkhouser,

344
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,911
I'd appreciate it next time,

345
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,116
don't roll up my sleeve
if I request you not to.

346
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,558
- Look at what you did to my shirt.
- What did I do?

347
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,118
- It's not clinging anymore.
- It's not clinging?

348
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,324
It's not clinging to the wrist
the way it's supposed to.

349
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,060
Fine, okay.
You know what?

350
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,035
- And one more thing, okay?
- What?

351
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,972
- Don't take any pictures of my mouth.
- What are you talking about?

352
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,907
You almost gave my wife
a heart attack

353
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,933
and you traumatized
a little girl!

354
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,275
- What?
- Hey, Walter Brennan!

355
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,009
"The barn's on fire!
The barn's on fire!"

356
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,643
I'm turning you in,
weatherman.

357
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:13,250
Hey, Larry, what happened
to you, buddy?

358
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,626
Fell in the toilet.

359
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,630
What do you mean?

360
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,258
Cheryl left
the toilet seat up.

361
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,825
I fell in.

362
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,133
- Really?
- Yeah.

363
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,140
- What, did you hurt yourself?
- Yeah, I hurt my back.

364
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,142
- I shouldn't be laughing.
- That's all right.

365
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:34,077
- It's funny, I guess.
- Well, no. I mean...

366
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,104
Hey, you know,
it's good that I ran into you.

367
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,015
Mary and I
were talking

368
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,451
this morning, and, uh,
what we decided to do

369
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,853
is we're gonna go
ahead and board

370
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:47,689
- Roxy, our dog.
- What?

371
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,126
I know you offered
to take care of her, but, uh,

372
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,962
I just think it's better
to put it into a kennel.

373
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,126
It's a small dog.
Wouldn't be much fun anyway.

374
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,399
I was kind of looking
forward to it. I like dogs.

375
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,404
Yeah yeah.

376
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,375
I just think...
I just think, you know,

377
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,536
maybe next time
or something.

378
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,478
But I really appreciate
the offer. I do.

379
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,072
Thank you.
That was sweet of you.

380
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,141
- Talk to Susie today by any chance?
- Yeah.

381
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,085
I talked to her this morning.
I had to apologize

382
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,712
for not being at
the party last night.

383
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:20,919
She mention anything
about, uh, last night?

384
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,756
Yeah, she was kind of miffed
that we didn't call.

385
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,492
We had to go
someplace else.

386
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,967
We were supposed
to be there, but why?

387
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,371
- No reason.
- Oh.

388
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,499
All right, I'm going
to go hit some...

389
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,033
hit some balls.
I'll see ya.

390
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,913
Yeah, see ya.

391
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,088
- Hey.
- Came for my sneaker.

392
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,257
All right.
What happened to you?

393
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,359
- I fell in the toilet.
- How'd you fall in the toilet?

394
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,166
I went to go pee
and the seat was up.

395
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,538
- What does that have to do with you?
- I pee sitting down.

396
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,066
- You pee sitting down?
- Yeah. Have you ever tried it?

397
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,408
- No!
- It's more comfortable.

398
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,038
When you get up during the night

399
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,242
you don't have
to turn the light on and wake up.

400
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,342
- And you get to read.
- What are you reading?

401
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,149
- I'm reading a lot of stuff.
- What stuff?

402
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,156
If I pee 20 times
during a day,

403
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,819
- I get through the "New York Times."
- 20 times?

404
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,057
When you're peeing all over your shoe,
I'm learning something.

405
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,031
What makes you think
I'm peeing over my shoe?

406
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,897
Just get my sneaker.

407
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,630
- I don't need to discuss this.
- Jeffrey, who's there?

408
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,400
- Larry.
- Carmelita, put Oscar in the bedroom

409
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,374
and close the door.

410
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,512
- Hey.
- Hi, Lar.

411
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,914
Get this, the weatherman
is a total fraud.

412
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,147
He predicts thundershowers
so nobody will show up

413
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,212
and he'll have
the golf course to himself.

414
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,282
I just came from there,
he's playing with your cousin.

415
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,988
- Why do you pee sitting down?
- Many reasons.

416
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,724
You crap
standing up?

417
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,562
By the way,
you left last night.

418
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,727
You were about to give me
the weatherman's tip

419
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,828
- and you never gave it to me.
- I can't.

420
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,806
He just called me and said,
"Don't give it to Larry."

421
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,275
What an asshole.

422
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,141
- He's not an asshole.
- He is an asshole.

423
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,681
The fuck
happened to you?

424
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,708
Cheryl got nauseous
from your dinner last night

425
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,051
and she left
the toilet seat up,

426
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,215
and then I went to pee
and fell in the toilet.

427
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,454
- She didn't get sick from my dinner.
- How are you feeling?

428
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,895
- I'm not feeling great.
- Marty, you're never feeling great.

429
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,398
- And let me ask you a question.
- What?

430
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,401
Did you talk
to Ted Danson today?

431
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,666
Yeah, he called to see
how the party went.

432
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,232
'Cause I was supposed
to take care of his dog...

433
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,772
and then suddenly he told me
I didn't need to.

434
00:21:54,813 --> 00:22:00,080
- Mm, I wonder why.
- Yeah, I wonder.

435
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,790
I'll get
your sneaker.

436
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,296
Marty, let me ask
you a question.

437
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,029
Does your father
have good Hodgkin's?

438
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,903
Oscar ate it.

439
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:33,384
Well, I am the good news-bad news kid.
The good news is, folks,

440
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,511
that wonderful weather
we've been enjoying

441
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,419
all week in the whole
Los Angeles basin,

442
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,289
that's going to continue tonight
and all day tomorrow, Saturday.

443
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,488
If you're going to the Leo Funkhouser
testimonial, I'll see you there.

444
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,463
We're gonna have a wonderful day
and Leo, nobody deserves this more.

445
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:49,899
But the bad news is, we have
a cold weather front

446
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,267
that's gonna push in around
midnight Saturday night.

447
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,000
We're gonna have thundershowers
all day Sunday

448
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,600
and they're gonna continue
all the way into Monday.

449
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,009
Folks, don't shoot me, I'm just the
messenger. All right, back to you.

450
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,680
I'm not dressed
appropriately for this.

451
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,015
- I think you're fine.
- What are you doing?

452
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,180
- These are name tags.
- Name tags?

453
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,656
Okay.

454
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,249
What for?

455
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,692
- Everybody wears name tags.
- What?

456
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,322
- Thank you.
- Hi. Hi, Cheryl.

457
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,888
- Hi, Saul.
- What's happening?

458
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,991
- Just putting on our name tags.
- Name tags?

459
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,899
Yeah, everybody's
wearing a name tag.

460
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,699
- What's wrong?
- I gotta wear a name tag?

461
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,400
You're a little too sophisticated
to wear a name tag?

462
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,807
No, it has nothing to do with that.
It's my jacket.

463
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,835
If I put this on, it's gonna leave
little paper remnants.

464
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,781
- It's gonna ruin the suede.
- Look, this comes off, it goes on.

465
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,444
- Just like that.
- You already ruined a shirt of mine

466
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,612
- by rolling up my sleeve.
- There, okay?

467
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,555
It's on. You're gonna go celebrate
with everybody else.

468
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,026
Come on, let's just go inside, okay?
What do you say?

469
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,584
- Okay.
- All right, okay, fine.

470
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,654
- Thank you for coming, Cheryl.
- Thank you.

471
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,029
It'll be fine.
It's not very nice suede anyway.

472
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,590
Okay.

473
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,661
Did you have any idea
it was gonna be this big?

474
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,366
Here's our table.

475
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,934
- Hey, there's Jeff.
- Hey, Lar.

476
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,138
- What's up?
- You guys aren't at our table?

477
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,308
Why don't you switch? Nobody's
gonna notice. I don't know these people.

478
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,443
- Who's gonna know?
- It's like they do this on purpose.

479
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,010
Excuse me,
what are you doing?

480
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,921
Making sure the placecards
are where they're supposed to be.

481
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,949
- This is mine and my husband's.
- Jenny and Sam.

482
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:25,019
- I think this is...
- Oh, and you're Larry. Larry David.

483
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,429
You're supposed to be
at this table, yeah.

484
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,661
I heard about your
tooth plaque problem...

485
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,363
- My what?
- Your problem with your tooth plaque.

486
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,805
No no no! I don't have a problem.
Where'd you get this from?

487
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,934
- It's not important who said it.
- It's not important?

488
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,412
- The hygienist? Did she tell you?
- l... I really...

489
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,938
- Who, Dr. Funkhouser?
- I know about this really great product

490
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,952
- that could help you out.
- I don't have a tooth plaque problem.

491
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,784
I floss probably more often
than anybody in this room.

492
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,689
- Good, you don't need to know.
- Just do me a favor.

493
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,922
- Don't mention this.
- Don't be so sensitive.

494
00:24:56,962 --> 00:25:00,420
It's not something...
I didn't grow up dreaming of doing this.

495
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,228
It's not something
I even thought about.

496
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,497
It's something that I was good at.
I had the voice for it...

497
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,437
Well, if it isn't the old
reliable weatherman.

498
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,599
Hey, Larry,
where's your cane?

499
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:13,407
- Back's all better.
- Good, good. Yeah, nice.

500
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:16,209
So, uh, you
called Marty Funkhouser,

501
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,546
specifically told him
not to give me the tip?

502
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,483
Yeah, exactly
what I did.

503
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,680
I got a little tip for you,

504
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,985
- weatherman, okay?
- Okay.

505
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,186
Expect to find a little company tomorrow
on the golf course.

506
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,990
- I heard your little report last night.
- Lar?

507
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,589
Bring a raincoat. It's gonna thundershower
all day tomorrow.

508
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,499
- You won't see me out there.
- Oh, I'm really worried.

509
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,503
- Bring a slicker.
- It's not gonna work.

510
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,300
It's not gonna
work tomorrow, buddy.

511
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,306
- Good to see your back's better.
- Yeah.

512
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,270
Well, this is a great day,
as you all know,

513
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,040
here at Rolling Valley
Country Club.

514
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,173
35 years ago
to this date,

515
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,343
my father Leo Funkhouser

516
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,115
joined this club.

517
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,555
And at the time, we were the first
and only Jewish family.

518
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,583
And today we still are,
but we love this place.

519
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,489
It's great to see
all your faces here,

520
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,502
and this is a very special day
for all of us.

521
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:15,996
It's not often that a son gets
to honor his father

522
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,771
in front of his friends.
It's usually after the fact.

523
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,472
And I'm so proud of my dad.
He's meant so much to me.

524
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,778
When we were little
and I was a baby...

525
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,284
Oh, look at this.

526
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,150
Look at that!

527
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,155
That's it, that's the end
of the jacket.

528
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,623
When I was three years old,
he couldn't do it anymore

529
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,353
'cause I was
taller than he was.

530
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,927
What a great day.
There's not a lot I can say.

531
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,925
Leo, right now,
as you all know, has retired.

532
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,029
My mom couldn't be here
tonight, of course.

533
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,131
She passed away
10 years ago...

534
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,111
Excuse me.

535
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,639
Can you keep it down a little bit?
'Cause it's loud.

536
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,653
I have to translate for my husband.
He doesn't understand.

537
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,656
I understand, but just
be a little quieter, that's all.

538
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,591
Yeah, drink your tea
or coffee.

539
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,323
- My husband said be quiet.
- I'm just trying to hear...

540
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,423
I'm trying to hear what
your cousin has to say.

541
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,333
Yeah, shut your mouth.
You can see your plaque.

542
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,429
What did he say? Shut my mouth?
I don't have any plaque.

543
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,702
- You tell him I don't have any plaque.
- Shh!

544
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,867
- You have full mouth full of plaque.
- Oh, yeah?

545
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,709
At least I don't hide my baldness
with a yarmulke.

546
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,049
- He has more hair than you.
- Bet you got nothing under that.

547
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,453
He'll show it to you
if you'll show him glasses.

548
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,687
Tell him he don't touch
my glasses.

549
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,717
- Give your glasses!
- Don't you touch those!

550
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,663
Larry, okay. Larry!

551
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,927
Ow, I hurt
my back again.

552
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,198
Let's bring the roof
down for my father,

553
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,831
Leo Funkhouser.

554
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,739
Larry, get up.

555
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,046
I can't.
I hurt my back.

556
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,678
- Stand up.
- I can't.

557
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,650
I hurt my back.

558
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,250
- Larry, get up.
- My back hurts!

559
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,455
- Up up up!
- Cheryl, I can't.

560
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:20,089
- Stand up.
- Come on, stand up.

561
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,759
- Larry! Come on!
- I can't.

562
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:27,234
I hurt my back.
I hurt my back.

563
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,101
- Get up.
- Get up.

564
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,476
It had
to freaking rain.

565
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,783
It had to
freaking rain!
