00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,684
Did you call Funkhouser?

5
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,684
No, I'll send
a card or something.

6
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:21,951
That's terrible, what
happened to his mother.

7
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:23,584
I know.

8
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:25,917
I mean, driving a wheelchair,
getting hit by a car?

9
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:28,116
- That's unbelievable.
- Wasn't a surprise.

10
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:31,216
- No, it was not a surprise.
- Completely reckless in that thing.

11
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:34,116
Wow. You know,
over on sunset,

12
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:36,650
They got a memorial site
all set up for her.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,017
- Really?
- Yep. Right where she got hit.

14
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:41,283
- Huh.
- All these flowers.

15
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:44,017
You know what?
He owes me $50 from golf.

16
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:45,951
That's $50 you're
never gonna see.

17
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:48,850
- Never! Never gonna see that 50.
- Never ever ever ever.

18
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:51,517
You can't ask
a mourner for $50.

19
00:00:56,884 --> 00:00:58,684
- Huh.
- Uh-Huh.

20
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:00,684
Well, i'm waiting.

21
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:02,417
Yeah, me too.

22
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:04,917
What are you
waiting for?

23
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:07,116
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm waiting for you

24
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:09,584
To offer me condolences
for Funkhouser's mother.

25
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:11,317
Yeah, that's what i'm
waiting for from you.

26
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,450
I am so much closer
with Marty than you are.

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,116
I've known him
so much longer.

28
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:17,951
However long you've known him
is irrelevant in this equation.

29
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:19,850
All right, listen,
i watered the plants.

30
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,750
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:24,150
- Let's go get some ice cream.
- Oh, that's just what he needs.

32
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:26,684
- Just what he needs. Go! Enjoy yourself.
- That is a good idea!

33
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,684
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Thank you.

34
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:31,216
Oh, and Jeff! Don't forget,
we've got the interview later

35
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:32,984
For Sammy
to get into Dryden.

36
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,951
- Very important.
- I'm all good, don't worry about it.

37
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:37,617
What's with you?
When's your interview?

38
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,417
I think it's tomorrow.

39
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,483
It would be very nice
if daryl and Keysha

40
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:43,650
Went to the same school as
sammy. Wouldn't that be nice?

41
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,650
How do you know
Sammy's getting in?

42
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:48,317
Sammy happens to be
a very very bright girl.

43
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:51,051
Yeah, well, Keysha and Daryl are no
slouches, either. I can tell you that.

44
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:53,650
- Well, good.
- Daryl knows the whole multiplication table.

45
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,417
Well, that's great, Larry,

46
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,617
But i wouldn't take so much
credit, because it's not your dna.

47
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,517
I sit up at night
teaching it to 'em.

48
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:02,350
- Sammy knows multiplication and division.
- All right, shut up!

49
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,350
- That's it, let's go! Come on.
- Long division!

50
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:06,984
- Let's go.
- What the heck?

51
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:13,684
- I think i'll get Cheryl an ice cream.
- Very nice.

52
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:17,051
Yeah, well, on the days
i want sex i'm a lot nicer.

53
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,417
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, i'll be nice the whole day.

54
00:02:19,517 --> 00:02:21,483
And then we'll have sex.

55
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:23,417
And then i'll just go back
to being the way i am.

56
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:25,584
- It's fascinating.
- And it works for you.

57
00:02:25,684 --> 00:02:27,784
What is that banana thing?

58
00:02:27,884 --> 00:02:29,684
I love these people
that come here,

59
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:31,717
They get 10 samples,
you know?

60
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:33,617
And it's not right for
the woman working back there.

61
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:36,350
She's got better things to do than
just scooping out samples for them.

62
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,317
They're all so good.

63
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:40,984
But what... what is this...
oh... choc... chocolate...

64
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,517
Look at this. People are
waiting. That's not right.

65
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:45,150
No, it's not.

66
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,350
You know, i shouldn't
be eating ice cream.

67
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,317
- No, you shouldn't.
- No, i really shouldn't.

68
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:51,850
I don't know
what i came here for.

69
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:53,850
I can't even be...
you mind if i go?

70
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:56,417
- 'Cause if i stay here i'll have
no self-Control. - Get out of here!

71
00:02:56,517 --> 00:02:58,483
- All right, bye.
- Get out.

72
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:03,350
Can i try the ras... raspberry
chocolate, whatever that is?

73
00:03:05,283 --> 00:03:06,817
Got a long wait.

74
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,417
-- ooh, could i
try the tiramisu?

75
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:10,083
It's good.
That's a good one.

76
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:11,817
That's a good one.
Get that. Get that.

77
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:13,617
- I think i will. Thank you.
- Yeah, get that.

78
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:15,450
And i think i'd like
to try the banana, please.

79
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,984
Banana!

80
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,984
It might taste like...

81
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:22,150
- Let me guess, a banana?
- And some chocolate.

82
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,150
- I mean this is really rid... this is so rude.
- Just the plain chocolate.

83
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,350
You know, you're like a sample
abuser. That's what you are.

84
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,051
- What is the matter with you?
- You're abusing your sampling privileges.

85
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,051
- One... two samples, the most.
- What do you think they have these little spoons for?

86
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,951
- You can't just go on sample after sample... no you can't!
- Oh, yes, i can!

87
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:38,650
You know what? I'm just gonna
have the plain vanilla, please.

88
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:41,650
- Thank you.
- Oh! A decision's been made!

89
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:43,417
Oh, we got vanilla!

90
00:03:43,517 --> 00:03:45,617
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

91
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,550
Vanilla!
She winds up with vanilla.

92
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,550
You got to be kidding me.

93
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,350
How is the vanilla?

94
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,317
-- Hey! Funkhouser!

95
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:06,183
My god,
i can't believe it.

96
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:07,784
You're out?

97
00:04:07,884 --> 00:04:09,717
- What are you... what are you doing?
- Well, uh...

98
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,383
This helps my emotions.

99
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,283
Jogging's the best
thing for me.

100
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:15,917
So, mourners...
mourners exercise?

101
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:18,183
- I didn't know that.
- I don't know if mourners exercise.

102
00:04:18,283 --> 00:04:20,450
- It's just good for me.
- Interesting.

103
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,650
I'm gonna
remember that next time

104
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:24,984
I lose a close
member of my family.

105
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,717
Yeah. Jogging.

106
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:28,283
- Helps everything.
- By the way,

107
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,417
I called your house.
I left a condolence message.

108
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:32,083
I never got a return call.

109
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,083
Well, i had a few
things on my mind.

110
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:37,183
Yeah, still...

111
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:39,083
It's a little discourteous.

112
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,550
- Let me explain something to you.
- Sure.

113
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,483
I lost my dad a year ago.

114
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,550
My mother just died.

115
00:04:46,717 --> 00:04:48,684
I'm an orphan, okay?

116
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:50,784
- You're a what?
- I'm an orphan.

117
00:04:50,884 --> 00:04:52,750
- Orphan?
- Yeah, an orphan!

118
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,750
You're a little too old
to be an orphan.

119
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,116
No, if you don't have
parents you're an orphan.

120
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:57,417
You could be 70
and be an orphan?

121
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,116
You could be 100
and be an orphan!

122
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,584
- You can't be 100 and be an orphan.
- Yeah, you can!

123
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:03,784
Okay.
Little orphan Funkhouser.

124
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,784
Let me ask you something...

125
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:08,183
One of the things that
bothers me a lot in life,

126
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:11,017
Is when ice cream drips down the side
of a cone. Doesn't that bother you?

127
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:14,450
That's why you have to be very vigilant
when you're eating ice cream cones.

128
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:16,850
Look, there's a little drip.
Get it!

129
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:19,150
Oh, another drip!
Got it!

130
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:21,250
Are you coming
to the funeral?

131
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:23,617
Of course i'm coming
to the funeral.

132
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,150
Okay, i'm gonna give you the
$50 i owe you for the golf bet.

133
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,584
- Oh my god!
- Hold this.

134
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:29,250
$50... i forgot all
about it, the $50.

135
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:31,150
- Yeah.
- Great!

136
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,483
- What are you doing?
- Taking off my shoe. I got money in the shoe.

137
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,951
- What?!
- There you go.

138
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:41,483
Ugh!

139
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:42,850
- Take the $50!
- No, i don't want it.

140
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:44,850
- Take the $50!
- I'd really rather not.

141
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:46,850
- I don't want that 50 from your sweaty...
- Take the 50 bucks.

142
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:49,584
- Disgusting sock and sneaker.
- This is the payoff.

143
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,884
That's... i don't want that 50.
Give me a clean 50.

144
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,250
- This is the 50 i have.
- I'm not touching that 50. I don't want it.

145
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,617
- Take the 50.
- No!

146
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:57,350
- Then i'm not paying you!
- What?

147
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,417
- I'm not paying you. This is the $50.
- You owe me $50!

148
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:00,984
- What if...
- This is $50!

149
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:03,350
It's perfectly fine.

150
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:05,784
See? $50.

151
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:07,617
- All right, this is bullshit.
- Take it.

152
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,216
Hold it out.
Hold it out, fold it up.

153
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:13,317
Fold it... that's it, okay.

154
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:16,150
Put it in my pocket.

155
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:17,951
Yeah, okay.
Put it in there.

156
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:20,951
Thank you.

157
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,450
- Hey, Cheryl.
- What's up, l.D.?

158
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:26,784
- Hey!
- What you got there?

159
00:06:26,884 --> 00:06:29,083
- Ice cream.
- Ice cream?

160
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,350
Ooh! I love ice cream.
What flavor did you bring us?

161
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,216
Actually, uh...

162
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:36,617
I just kinda got it
for...

163
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:37,951
For Cheryl.

164
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,850
You just brought some
ice cream just for Cheryl?

165
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,617
You didn't bring none
to share with us?

166
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:44,150
Well, see, here's the thing.
I'm not really used to...

167
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,317
Thinking about other
people other than Cheryl.

168
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:48,784
- Oh.
- So, it's not like i did it on purpose.

169
00:06:48,884 --> 00:06:50,984
- Uh-Huh. - The thought just
didn't even enter my mind.

170
00:06:51,116 --> 00:06:53,483
It's not like it entered my mind and
i thought "no, the hell with them."

171
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:56,517
See the difference? Sin
of comission, omission.

172
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,984
That's a sin of omission,
much better than the comission.

173
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,517
I think it's an
omission/comission thing.

174
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:01,884
But you still
forgot about us.

175
00:07:01,984 --> 00:07:04,617
So next time, just bring
like the family-Order size...

176
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:06,450
- I will.
- ... that they got there.

177
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,350
- I will. I'm sorry, Loretta.
- That's all right.

178
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,984
- I forgive you.
- Thank you.

179
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,517
- Hey, Cheryl.
- Hey.

180
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:13,784
Hey.
Got you ice cream!

181
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:16,717
Did you just get in a fight with
someone at the ice cream shop?

182
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:18,984
Uh... yeah.

183
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,517
Yeah, well,
what happened?

184
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,984
Well, this woman was
taking a lot of samples...

185
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,984
- Let me just tell Loretta something.
- Yeah.

186
00:07:27,116 --> 00:07:28,684
This woman that
he's talking about

187
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:31,650
Is the dean of admissions
at dryden school.

188
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,917
-- That nice school we was
trying to get the kids in?

189
00:07:34,017 --> 00:07:35,717
Yeah. Now, there's a problem
with their application.

190
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:36,984
But how do you even
know about this?

191
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,984
Because i just got
a phone call, Larry.

192
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,550
- Ooh.
- Let me just say this, okay?

193
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:43,450
The woman was standing
in front of the counter

194
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,051
Getting sample after sample.
She had 10 samples!

195
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:48,417
- You're allowed to do that.
- You're allowed to get free samples.

196
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:49,884
- No, you're not allowed...
- Yes, you are.

197
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:51,817
Why you think they get them
little, bitty, cute spoons there?

198
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:54,817
- I know why they got they got the cute spoons.
- So you can take...

199
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:57,083
Maybe one or two. Don't
abuse your sampling privilege!

200
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,884
She abused
the sampling privilege.

201
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:00,517
- And you know what else?
- What?

202
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:02,884
I was also watching out
for the counterwoman as well.

203
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:04,917
If she had a problem
with that woman,

204
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,183
Don't you think she would say
"excuse me, ma'am"?

205
00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:09,083
No no! 'Cause she's always
told the customer's right.

206
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:12,017
And inact, the customer is
usually a moron and an asshole.

207
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,817
But you know something, Larry? You
should've mind your business on this one.

208
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:18,017
She was breaking the rules. She
wasn't following the rules of society.

209
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,083
- What rules?
- The unwritten rules

210
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:22,617
That we have as we
go about our day!

211
00:08:22,717 --> 00:08:25,684
- Like what?
- Like at night, you tiptoe.

212
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:29,450
That's an unwritten rule. You
tiptoe so you don't wake people up.

213
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,150
You tiptoe. There's no sign, "tiptoe."

214
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,083
You just have
to be smart enough

215
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,817
And considerate
enough to do it.

216
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:38,917
Okay, well, you know what? I'm glad
that you're so pleased with yourself

217
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:41,116
Because now Keysha and Daryl
are not going to get

218
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,917
The education that
we were hoping they'd get.

219
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:44,383
That's a real good
school, Larry.

220
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,650
And we've been working on
that for so long.

221
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,083
- Good school.
- Courting that woman.

222
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:51,350
What you gonna do, l.D.?

223
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,017
I'll go and...
i'll go apologize.

224
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:56,383
That... that's nice.

225
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,917
You know what else?
I'll get her some flowers too.

226
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:00,784
That's a good start.
I'm down with that.

227
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:02,650
- That sounds good.
- You like the flower idea?

228
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:04,717
That's a good one. 'Cause i
want them kids in that school.

229
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,617
I'm... i'm gonna
rectify it.

230
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:08,350
I'm a great rectifier.
That's what i do.

231
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,550
I break down,
i rectify.

232
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,283
Just say i'm sorry,

233
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:16,017
We love the school,
and... and leave.

234
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:17,917
You... you don't
need to tell me

235
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:19,550
How to apologize to people.

236
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,283
I've been apologizing to people
since i'm six years old

237
00:09:22,383 --> 00:09:24,917
On a daily basis.
I pretty much have it down.

238
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:27,750
- So you got this?
- Is it always effective?

239
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,750
- Your apologies?
- Pretty effective.

240
00:09:29,884 --> 00:09:31,483
Okay, go.

241
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:34,083
Hey hey, how about a thank you?
I bought you some ice cream.

242
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:35,717
Yeah, one scoop
for the whole house.

243
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:38,017
- Thank you, Larry.
- I'm nice!

244
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,517
I got you the ice cream!

245
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:41,250
There's no
acknowledgment of that?

246
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,750
Hey, mr. David,
i finished up all the painting.

247
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,017
It's... well, 11:20 now,

248
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:49,450
I got here at 9:20, so...

249
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,483
That's a couple hours,
50 bucks.

250
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,717
I'm hoping you're
pleased with it now.

251
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:56,283
Umm, let me
ask you a question.

252
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:59,017
- Mm-Hmm? - I mean, i
really don't care about it.

253
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:02,116
It doesn't make a difference to
me either way, but i'm just curious

254
00:10:02,283 --> 00:10:05,483
Because i know when i left you were
in the bathroom for about 20 minutes.

255
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:08,383
- Now i came back and you're in the bathroom again.
- Yeah.

256
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:12,083
So i'm kinda be charged for what,
like a half hour of your toilet time?

257
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:13,817
Oh, no no no.

258
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:16,183
It's just kind of
all-Inclusive.

259
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,116
Yeah, i don't really
punch a clock, right?

260
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:20,283
- You don't punch a clock, do you?
- I don't punch a clock.

261
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:22,784
I don't charge people for
going on the toilet, though.

262
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,951
- All right, but that's okay. Doesn't matter, either way.
- Great, thank you.

263
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:27,584
- $50?
- I appreciate that.

264
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,951
- Whoa.
- There you go.

265
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:34,684
- What's that?
- It's $50.

266
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,317
Uh... you know...

267
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:39,116
You don't want it?

268
00:10:39,216 --> 00:10:41,350
- No, i want money, but...
- Take it.

269
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:43,850
It's a good 50!

270
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,550
You don't want it?

271
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,750
No, i just don't know where
you dragged that thing out of.

272
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,850
I mean, you know, that's...

273
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:52,216
I... i think... do you
have any other money, or...

274
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:55,450
Fine.

275
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,250
Change...

276
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,450
I got, uh...

277
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:04,417
$45.90.

278
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:06,717
- $45.90?
- Yeah.

279
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:08,450
Or...

280
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,450
I can give you the 50.

281
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:11,984
No.

282
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,083
I'll take the $45.90.

283
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,417
Thank you.

284
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,617
Okay.

285
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,250
I'm gonna get these.

286
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,884
All right.
Those are 35.

287
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:29,550
Okay.

288
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,817
No.

289
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:45,150
Hey, Funkhouser.

290
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,717
Call me back. No one's taking
this 50. I can't get rid of it.

291
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:50,684
I'll be home in an hour.

292
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:33,083
-- As you know, my wife and I

293
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:36,116
Took in a homeless family who
were victims of hurricane edna.

294
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,450
And... and i was so anxious
to bring 'em the ice cream back

295
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:44,717
That perhaps i was a little too
impatient in the store with you.

296
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:46,283
And i... i'm...

297
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:48,383
Completely apologize.
I'm so sorry, but...

298
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,250
- I was just thinking about those kids...
- Right.

299
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,017
...waiting for that ice cream
that they haven't had in months.

300
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,984
And when i got home,
finally, they said,

301
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,450
- "Oh, daddy, what took"... you know they call me daddy.
- Oh, really?

302
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,417
- Yeah, it's really sweet.
- That's nice. That's very nice.

303
00:13:00,517 --> 00:13:01,984
I really love being
called daddy.

304
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,051
I don't particularly
like children,

305
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,116
- That's why i don't really
have any. - Uh-Huh.

306
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:09,216
- But i like being called daddy.
- Yes yes. I can see.

307
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,350
It... i've never felt anything
like that before in my life.

308
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,350
"Daddy, daddy!
You got the ice cream!"

309
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,250
- Uh-Huh.
- "What took so long, daddy?"

310
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:18,383
And i said,
"well, you know,

311
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:20,984
I had a little incident
at the ice cream store.

312
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,750
But anyway, i'd love for you
to have these flowers

313
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:27,450
And accept my heartfelt
and humble apology.

314
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,017
Apology accepted.

315
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,083
- Mmm!
- Thank you so much.

316
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:34,617
- Oh, they smell wonderful.
- Aren't they beautiful?

317
00:13:34,717 --> 00:13:37,684
Well, you know, it's just such a
rare thing for someone to come in

318
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,750
And just admit
right off the top,

319
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,850
I was at fault.
It was me, i was rude.

320
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:44,483
I was obnoxious,
i'm not such a great person.

321
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:47,216
It's just really refreshing.
It's really rare.

322
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,483
Saying all that,
i am a pretty good person.

323
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:51,483
- I did take in a homeless family.
- Yes.

324
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,550
Excuse me one moment.
Kelly!

325
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,984
Could you
come in for a sec?

326
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,017
- Anyway...
- Well, hold on.

327
00:13:58,116 --> 00:13:59,850
We're gonna need
a vase for this.

328
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:02,483
- Ooh, ooh! Fabric samples!
- Fabric samples.

329
00:14:02,617 --> 00:14:05,183
Fabric samples.
They're so beautiful.

330
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:07,884
- Mmm.
- What are you doing with the fabrics?

331
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:09,750
- Oh, i'm gonna redo this couch.
- Oh.

332
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:11,784
Is this the one i chose?

333
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:15,116
Uh, no, actually. Wasn't
that the one that you wanted?

334
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:17,017
Oh, yes, but now
i want this.

335
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:19,017
Yeah, she... she
doesn't know what to do.

336
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:22,051
- No, i don't.
- Yeah, you really liked the red tones.

337
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:23,784
I know.
I know, i did.

338
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:26,051
- I like the one you chose.
- The one i chose...

339
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,750
- I'll...
- Yeah, i will see you tomorrow then, i guess.

340
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,150
- I'll see you tomorrow for our interview.
- Yeah, that's right.

341
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,051
Oh, god, see, there's this
kind of turquoise color in here.

342
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,850
- It's just...
- They're all nice.

343
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:37,417
- They're lovely.
- Yes, they are.

344
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:39,317
They are all nice,
that's the problem.

345
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:41,951
Yeah, that's what you need to
do, you need to pick one, see?

346
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:43,951
If only it were
that simple.

347
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,717
- Yeah. It is that simple, really.
- Yeah, but see the blue?

348
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:48,717
You want them all,
you can't have them all.

349
00:14:48,884 --> 00:14:50,717
- I want them all.
- You got to kinda take one.

350
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:52,584
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, okay.

351
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,350
- Oh, god, what do i do?
- Take it, pick it out.

352
00:14:56,517 --> 00:14:58,884
You still want me
to take this one.

353
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,884
-- I'm home!

354
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:32,817
One for you
and one for you.

355
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:35,617
What?
L.D., this is nice.

356
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,617
My two favorite girls.
Come on, give it up.

357
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:39,884
Aw!

358
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:41,817
- So it went well?
- I broke it down...

359
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:44,884
- And i rectified.
- You rectified?

360
00:15:44,984 --> 00:15:46,350
- See this hand?
- Uh-Huh.

361
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,350
That's where she
just had some lunch.

362
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,784
- That's what i'm talking about.
- So the application is okay

363
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:54,350
- And everything's back on track?
- It's so on track.

364
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,817
- So on track.
- You couldn't shake that train off.

365
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,550
- The kids are gonna appreciate that.
- Larry.

366
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,650
These are real nice, l.D.

367
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:02,350
That is so sweet.
Thank you.

368
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,617
- I'm gonna put these in some water.
- Okay.

369
00:16:04,717 --> 00:16:06,183
All right.

370
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:07,917
Put 'em in...
put 'em in something

371
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,550
- And then, you know.
- What are you doing?

372
00:16:09,717 --> 00:16:11,550
- Come on upstairs.
- Go upstairs?

373
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:13,317
- Come on.
- Let me put it in some water.

374
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:17,350
Yeah, that can wait
just one second.

375
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,383
Hey!

376
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:29,550
Why did you leave that stupid
message on my answering machine?

377
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,984
- What?
- I don't want to hear about the money anymore.

378
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,017
No one will take this money.
I couldn't give it to a bum.

379
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:37,150
Listen to me. I don't
care about the money.

380
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,383
Someone stole flowers

381
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,450
That were marking the spot where
my mother was hit in her wheelchair.

382
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,984
- Really?
- Yes.

383
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,650
I'm not a violent person.
But if i find this guy,

384
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:51,617
I don't know what i'm
gonna do to him.

385
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:58,017
- Hmm.
- I can't believe that a human being would do that.

386
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:01,216
How would you even know
the flowers are missing?

387
00:17:01,383 --> 00:17:04,051
I keep track of it. I drive
by there 10 times a day.

388
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:08,283
Okay, you know what?
You should go home now.

389
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:11,383
Don't worry about the 50. I
don't even care about it anymore.

390
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:13,584
You know...

391
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:15,684
What is that i smell?

392
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,150
What? There's no smell.
What do you mean?

393
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:18,951
That's a white lily.

394
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:20,784
I don't even know what...
what... a white lily?

395
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,584
I know a white lily.

396
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:24,417
- Huh?
- I've got a good sense of smell.

397
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,917
What are you doing?

398
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:28,684
Where are you going?

399
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,051
There they are.
I knew it!

400
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,350
- Hi, Marty.
- Hi, how are you, Cheryl?

401
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:37,684
- Boy, those are beautiful.
- Thank you.

402
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:40,617
- Where'd you get 'em?
- Larry just brought 'em home for me.

403
00:17:41,951 --> 00:17:43,750
Where'd you
get the flowers?

404
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,250
Um... where'd i get those?

405
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:48,951
- Oh, ventura boulevard.
- What store?

406
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:50,584
What was it?

407
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:52,150
Uh...

408
00:17:53,216 --> 00:17:54,750
Where can i find a vase?

409
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:59,383
Did you take the flowers
at my mother's site?

410
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:00,917
- What?
- What?

411
00:18:01,017 --> 00:18:03,550
They wouldn't take the 50
at the flower store!

412
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,250
- How could you do that?!
- Oh, god.

413
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,984
Why? There are
so many of them.

414
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,784
- I didn't know it was such a big...
- So many of them?!

415
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:10,850
- Is that such a bad thing?
- They're not there to pick!

416
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:13,517
- You are the lowest of the low.
- I cannot believe you.

417
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:15,884
I have never heard anything
like that in my life.

418
00:18:15,984 --> 00:18:18,350
- How many flowers does she need?
- You took flowers

419
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:20,116
- From Marty's mother?
- Are these from a graveyard?

420
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:22,617
Not a graveyard.
It's a roadside memorial.

421
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:24,250
It's not such a... come on!

422
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,116
How could you do this?
And you know what?

423
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:29,884
I am missing one!
Where's the third bunch?

424
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,517
- I-I...
- There were three bouquets.

425
00:18:32,584 --> 00:18:35,784
- I know where it is.
- He will get you that bouquet.

426
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:38,350
I feel sorry for you.

427
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:41,517
If you weren't
my best friend,

428
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:43,083
I would take my bare hands

429
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:45,150
And pop your head
off your neck.

430
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,317
He's not my best friend.

431
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,951
You better
get those flowers!

432
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:56,684
Quick question...

433
00:18:56,784 --> 00:18:59,784
Is the other bouquet
in the dean's office?

434
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:01,684
Mmm... well...

435
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,150
Yeah.

436
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,784
That's great.

437
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:08,317
- I'm gonna go get it.
- Yeah. That's good.

438
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:10,517
And then after
i get 'em back...

439
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,083
- Anything i can do to...
- Get back upstairs?

440
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:17,450
Yeah.

441
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,550
Ummm...

442
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,884
I do like that
perfume belle fille.

443
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:24,183
- Belle fille.
- That would make me happy.

444
00:19:24,317 --> 00:19:27,517
- I know where it is. On wilshire blvd, right?
- Yes.

445
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:29,517
- That store on...
- That's only place that sells it.

446
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:31,817
Yes! Belle fille.

447
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:34,150
You... you got it.

448
00:20:27,383 --> 00:20:29,017
- Can i just add to it please?
- Sure.

449
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,083
- Thanks.
- Oh.

450
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:34,083
Wait wait wait, you know
what? I really like that too.

451
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:35,417
Are you looking for
anything in particular?

452
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:38,550
You know what? I'm not,
but these are wonderful.

453
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,051
Try that one.
That one's amazing.

454
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,283
So it's all
sort of a new line?

455
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,051
Yeah, those and we've
got different ones.

456
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,350
These are two citrus,
that one's... i know.

457
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,250
- I love that.
- So good, right?

458
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,216
Buy it. Buy it.
It's a good one.

459
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,017
- Get that one.
- This is a little bit like peppered with cinnamon.

460
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:56,017
- Uh-Huh.
- It's good.

461
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:58,550
Good, buy it.
That's a good one.

462
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,750
Um, i was looking for
something actually also

463
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:03,750
Which is very much
like that.

464
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:05,750
- Actually, i have this one at home.
- Do you really?

465
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:07,450
It's good.

466
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,984
- Can't really sample.
- Se, not a big fan.

467
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,550
You know? You can't sample
everything in the world.

468
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,917
It's just impossible. We'd
all like to try everything.

469
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:16,817
Even though i'd love to,
just can't.

470
00:21:16,917 --> 00:21:19,717
There's people in line,
people got to go places.

471
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:22,350
I go to a restaurant, can i
get everything on the menu?

472
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,550
I'd love to. Who doesn't
want everything on the menu?

473
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,317
You can't, you got to
order one thing. That's all.

474
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,951
I'm done.
I'm gonna take that.

475
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,917
Thank you
very much.

476
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:33,750
The sampling thing
has got to, you know,

477
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,550
We got to put an end
to it, you know?

478
00:21:35,717 --> 00:21:37,283
I'd like to be
with a lot of women,

479
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:40,350
I can't sample every woman.
You know what i'm talking about?

480
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,650
- What can i get for you?
- Yeah, belle fille.

481
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,817
It's that one.

482
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:48,650
- Here you are.
- You got it, that's great.

483
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,517
Sorry, i think
that's the last one.

484
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:54,383
I was on line ahead of him.
I was ahead of him.

485
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,550
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
have changed lines.

486
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:01,317
Can i get you
something else?

487
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,550
No, i don't want anything else. You
have a line problem in this store.

488
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,483
The lines move completely
disproportionately.

489
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:07,383
You know, there's
a way to fix that too.

490
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,317
Like they do in disneyland, you
know, how the line snakes around.

491
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,750
Go into a deli,
you take a number.

492
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,283
So it's fair, that's all.

493
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,584
'Cause you probably don't
add up stuff at the same rate.

494
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,750
There's a way
to solve it... one line.

495
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,116
It's not a crazy idea.

496
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:23,917
They wouldn't have stoned me
back 1000 years ago

497
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:25,283
For bringing up
the one-Line idea.

498
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:27,750
There's one line,
everybody feels good.

499
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:30,083
They don't feel
they're being cheated.

500
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,216
You have a rope,
you rope it off,

501
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,951
And people move up
fair and square.

502
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:36,483
Nobody's going
"oh oh, i can't move."

503
00:22:36,584 --> 00:22:38,116
You know,
look at them, look at me.

504
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:39,750
That's all, one line.

505
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,750
All right.
You know.

506
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,850
So Sammy would
be in seventh?

507
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:51,317
Correct, yes. And she's having
her bat mitzvah this year.

508
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,850
- That's wonderful.
- Yes, she'll be 13.

509
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:54,383
How is that going?
Is she enjoying it?

510
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,483
-- I have to tell you,

511
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,584
The way she's
learning her haphtarah...

512
00:22:58,717 --> 00:23:02,017
Because she's
actually understanding.

513
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:05,784
- That's very impressive.
- And it's proving interesting.

514
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,216
...and understanding the
meaning of what she's saying,

515
00:23:08,317 --> 00:23:09,784
Which is so
important to me.

516
00:23:09,884 --> 00:23:11,884
- Of course, of course.
- Yeah.

517
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,017
That's lovely.

518
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:17,984
- I think these traditions are very important.
-- Yes, it is important.

519
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,984
- It's a rite of passage.
- Yes, exactly.

520
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:26,684
And hobbies...
does she have any?

521
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,350
- Hey, hi.
-- Hello.

522
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,083
-- Hey.
- Mr. David.

523
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:48,717
- What are you doing here?
- Oh nothing, i was just...

524
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:51,283
Driving by the building. I knew you
guys were here for your interview.

525
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:53,517
I thought we'd go out, have a cup
of coffee, discuss the interview.

526
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:55,283
'Cause our kids
could be going together.

527
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,517
- Our kids could be going together.
-- Yeah.

528
00:23:57,617 --> 00:24:00,250
- He was here earlier today.
- Really, why?

529
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,784
To apologize to me

530
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:05,951
For being rude, obnoxious and
uncivil in the ice cream store.

531
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,984
She was taking a lot of time in
the ice cream store sampling...

532
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,684
But he brought me a lovely
bouquet of flowers in apology.

533
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,750
- They're right...
-- Uh-Huh.

534
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:14,984
-- Kelly, where
are the flowers?

535
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,884
They were just there.

536
00:24:16,984 --> 00:24:18,450
I just put 'em right there.

537
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,183
Well, where did they go?

538
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:27,517
This is fucking
great, Larry!

539
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:29,717
Now Sammy's
kicked out too.

540
00:24:29,817 --> 00:24:31,917
Just knowing you
is a liability.

541
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:34,283
We were in there, we're having
the interview, it's nice.

542
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:37,083
It looks like they're going to
accept her. And then you show up!

543
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:38,617
I don't know what to say.

544
00:24:38,717 --> 00:24:40,517
I'm real...
i'm... i'm sorry.

545
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,283
You know, these are children's
lives we're talking about, Larry.

546
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,216
Their future
is in our hands.

547
00:24:46,283 --> 00:24:48,216
You don't understand,
you just became a parent.

548
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,283
- But you have to take
responsibility. - I-I believe...

549
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,750
- I believe the children are our future.
-- Oh, you know what?

550
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:55,283
You have ruined my life!
You have ruined my life!

551
00:24:55,383 --> 00:24:58,017
- I have to live with this now!
- Oh, you bet he does!

552
00:24:58,116 --> 00:25:00,617
Oh, do you hear that?
I am fucked!

553
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:02,984
And you fucked me!
Hard!

554
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,650
She'll get into
another school.

555
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:06,650
We don't want another school.
We want this school!

556
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:08,550
We did all our research
for this school, man.

557
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,083
Can i have those flowers?

558
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:14,917
You want the flowers?

559
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,083
Take the fucking flowers!

560
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:43,283
Is that what this looked
like when you stole it?

561
00:25:43,383 --> 00:25:45,083
What?
Problem?

562
00:25:45,183 --> 00:25:46,717
Yeah, a big problem.

563
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:48,517
- No good?

564
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:51,216
- No good, no.
- Well, that's... that's the way i got 'em.

565
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:53,483
Come on, what?
What's wrong?

566
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:56,383
They should all stand up. That's
what flowers do when they're healthy.

567
00:25:57,951 --> 00:25:59,817
- Right.
- Stop picking up the petals, okay?

568
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:01,383
Well, i don't want to make
a mess in your house.

569
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:03,283
Don't worry about it.
You made enough of a mess.

570
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:04,850
- Okay, i'm... i'm sorry.
- Okay?

571
00:26:04,951 --> 00:26:06,584
- Okay.
- Who are all these people?

572
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,817
They're friends and
relatives from out of town.

573
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:11,350
They came in
for tomorrow's funeral.

574
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,917
- Is that Lewis?
- Yeah.

575
00:26:13,017 --> 00:26:14,383
Hey!

576
00:26:14,483 --> 00:26:16,283
Hey.

577
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:18,850
- What are you doing?
- I got to get out of here.

578
00:26:18,984 --> 00:26:20,984
I just... i just came here
to pay my respects

579
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,283
Because i... i can't
go to the funeral.

580
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:26,116
-- God, look at these
vultures going for that food!

581
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:28,417
-- These... these people,
they don't even chew.

582
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:31,550
You know, i bet if you threw a
quarter down, there'd be a stampede.

583
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,116
You know that?
This... i got to...

584
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:35,750
I got to get out of here.

585
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,383
I got the willies from this
whole... this whole place, man.

586
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:40,951
- What... what is that?
- That's his mother's shrine.

587
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:44,650
That's where Marty put all the
things she cherished in life...

588
00:26:44,817 --> 00:26:47,383
He gathered like some psycho
and put it on the table.

589
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:49,917
I... i got to go.

590
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:01,584
Cheryl, i'm home!

591
00:27:01,684 --> 00:27:03,517
- Look what i drew.
- Yeah, okay, yeah.

592
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,150
- Hey, Larry!
- Yeah, get away.

593
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:06,550
Yeah.

594
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,550
I got the perfume!

595
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:16,017
- You smell good.
- Thank you.

596
00:27:16,116 --> 00:27:18,383
Hey, you want to go to my
sister's after the service?

597
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:20,051
I don't think so.

598
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:26,650
-- Thanks for coming.
-- Sure.

599
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:31,984
Sorry, man.

600
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:42,684
Hey, thanks so much
for coming, appreciate it.

601
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:55,684
Do you smell something?

602
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:59,584
Yes, what is that?

603
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:01,483
That's mom's perfume.

604
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:05,216
You're right.

605
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,483
It's so strong.

606
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:14,917
- It's like she's
here with us.

607
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,051
Hey, somebody
dropped a 50!
