1
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,242
Thank God
you stopped.

1
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,276
Okay, um, I'm not
even gonna get

2
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,619
into what's wrong
with the actual choreography.

3
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,624
I'm gonna start
with your shoes, okay?

4
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,922
I told you to get
Capezio jazz oxfords.

5
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,519
I will get
those shoes today.

6
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,962
You'll get the shoes,
but you'll also get the steps.

7
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,693
So we'll break it
down one more time,

8
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,462
and just watch
only my feet.

9
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,062
I've been doing this
since I was seven.

10
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,265
My sounds are
a little off

11
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,274
'cause I don't really
practice that much.

12
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:45,539
Uh, you know what? I can do that,
but not the way you're doing it.

13
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,307
I can go...

14
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,905
Why can't I
just do that?

15
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,849
Because that's not
the choreography!

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,886
- There you go.
- Okay, I'm gonna think about this.

17
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,914
You move your feet. Nobody knows
what the hell's is going on down there.

18
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,586
- Dancers know, dance aficionados...
- Just dancers.

19
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,495
- Hello? Morning, everybody.
- Hey.

20
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,295
I'm Michael.

21
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,324
Yeah, Larry.

22
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,030
Michael.

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,904
- Nice to meet you.
- You know what?

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,273
I helped you move
three years ago.

25
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,800
Me and Richard Lewis.

26
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,574
You were standing
on the street.

27
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,776
You were soliciting
people for help.

28
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,944
Ah? Ah?

29
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,715
- You?
- That was me, me and Richard Lewis.

30
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,655
- I'm seeing him for lunch later.
- Larry!

31
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,215
- Larry! Larry.
- Oh my God!

32
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,817
That's amazing.

33
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,920
- What are you doing here?
- Small world...

34
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,828
- I'm the rehearsal pianist.
- Get out!

35
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,332
- Yeah.
- You're kidding?

36
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,857
- We'll be working together for a while.
- Fantastic.

37
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,802
This is my
girlfriend Rhonda.

38
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,272
- Hello.
- Hi, Larry. Nice to meet you.

39
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,036
Can you believe it?

40
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,975
I hooked up
with a model.

41
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,646
Boy, you lucked out.

42
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,345
- Hey. Morning.
- Hey!

43
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,012
How's it going?

44
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,353
- Ben, this is our... new pianist.
- Hi.

45
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,449
- Michael. Ben Stiller.
- How do you do?

46
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,825
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Michael.

47
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,352
This is my
girlfriend Rhonda.

48
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,488
- Hi.
- Hi, Ben.

49
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,021
Rhonda,
nice to meet you.

50
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,966
Hands off.
She's taken.

51
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,504
Hey, listen, I'm having
a birthday party on Saturday night.

52
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,632
You guys are all
invited to come, all right?

53
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,869
- Fantastic.
- My birthday was two weeks ago,

54
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,901
but we're having
the party this Saturday.

55
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,469
Thank you,
I'd love to come.

56
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,175
Yeah, and no gifts,
okay? No gifts.

57
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:32,150
How come you're having a party
on Saturday if it was two weeks ago?

58
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,346
Christine was out of town,
we couldn't get it together

59
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,356
- and it worked out this Saturday.
- Why even have it all?

60
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,051
Why not just forget it,
wait till next year?

61
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,787
- You blew it.
- Yeah, I know.

62
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,226
I wish we could've
done it last week,

63
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,593
but we couldn't
get it together.

64
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,393
You should bring Cheryl.
It'll be fun.

65
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,264
Kind of reminds me
a little of like President's Day.

66
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,064
It's not really
the President's birthday.

67
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,970
It's some other day.
What am I doing? You know...

68
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,530
Right.

69
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,836
We're back.

70
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,866
Let's start
at the top of the scene.

71
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,374
It's a total scam.
He introduced her as a model.

72
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:07,318
She's like completely bullshitting
this guy 'cause he's blind.

73
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,411
- By the way...
- Yeah.

74
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,285
Thank you for coming
to meet Kim.

75
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,985
I might've mentioned Kenny.
He's old my friend in New York.

76
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,427
She just moved out here from the city.
This is his first daughter,

77
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,930
and she calls me
like Uncle Richard.

78
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,592
- I've known her since she was born.
- Really?

79
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,157
That's fun,
"Uncle Richard."

80
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,796
Yeah, but the problem is
she's an actress, a singer, talented

81
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,805
but she wants to get
her breasts enlarged,

82
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,704
and it's gonna drive
Kenny crazy...

83
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,538
- He doesn't know about it?
- No.

84
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,340
- He's my old friend.
- Right.

85
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,437
I need you to help
to talk her out of it.

86
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,345
Just like a breast
intervention.

87
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,213
How am I supposed
to bring this up?

88
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,082
That's okay.
I'll think of something.

89
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,451
You always think of something.
I don't know.

90
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,353
Is everything else
good in your life?

91
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,517
- Be honest with me.
- Hmm?

92
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,857
For the first time in over
a quarter of a century,

93
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,420
tell me something
that's really bugging you.

94
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,091
I have nothing
to confide.

95
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,327
You have experienced
a lot you have not shared.

96
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,064
You've mentioned this
to me that I don't confide in you,

97
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,005
- and there's nothing to confide.
- You haven't confided in me

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,974
- in your entire life.
- How could you say...

99
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,738
- Hey!
- Hi!

100
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,176
- Hey.
- Uncle Richard!

101
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,806
Look at you from top to bottom.
What a doll, huh?

102
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,475
- Oh, baby.
- Hi.

103
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,313
This is my
fake niece Kim.

104
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,842
Larry David.
Larry, Kim.

105
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,376
- It is so nice to meet you.
- Hi.

106
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,286
I did sort of
a half get-up there.

107
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,156
- For my niece, fake niece...
- I should've done a full stand.

108
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,854
I think a full
get-up would've...

109
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,691
It's the thought
that counts. Listen,

110
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,493
I hope...
it's kind of weird,

111
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:29,092
but I'd really love for you to take
a look at my reel if you wouldn't mind.

112
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,194
You know, I mean,
I could take a look at it.

113
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,467
I'm not really...
I'm not doing TV right now.

114
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,804
- That's fine, it's fine.
- How you doing?

115
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,969
I'm doing really well.
Thank you. How are you?

116
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,502
- You look fabulous by the way.
- Oh, why thank you.

117
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,514
So Anna Nicole Smith,
she's got uh...

118
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,846
some pair of knockers
on her, huh?

119
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,680
They're not real though,
are they?

120
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,951
Huh?

121
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,355
- Whoa.
- Hey.

122
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,094
What's all... what's all that?
Look at all his gifts.

123
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,035
I thought you said we weren't
supposed to bring a present.

124
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,403
He said no gifts.
I don't get it.

125
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,998
- Hello. Hi, guys.
- Hey!

126
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,306
Let me ask you something.
Did you bring a gift?

127
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,709
- Of course.
- Yeah.

128
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,337
- See...
- He said no gifts.

129
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,678
Nobody means that.
You took that seriously?

130
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,911
- Of course I did. Look at all these.
- I know.

131
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,545
Oh, what do you got there, chicken?
Oh yeah, thank you.

132
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,817
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- No, thank you.

133
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,848
- You brought something, right?
- No, I didn't bring anything.

134
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,417
He said no gifts,
so I didn't bring anything.

135
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,123
- You're the only one.
- You guys are making me look bad.

136
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,133
- Happy birthday!
- Hey, thank you.

137
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,500
- Hey, happy birthday!
- Thanks for making it, yeah.

138
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,404
- So it's the two of you, huh?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

139
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,567
Exciting, that's great.

140
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,235
- Up on the boards together.
- Yeah.

141
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,006
- Figuring it out.
- It's going great?

142
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,672
It's going,
it's going.

143
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,547
- I think it's going pretty good.
- Yeah, it's going okay.

144
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,676
What should I do
with this thing?

145
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,277
I think a woman
will come around.

146
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,151
You can put it
on a table.

147
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,454
Every time I get one of these,
I wind up holding it the whole night.

148
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,016
It's a lot of dancing
you guys have to do.

149
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,188
- Oh, man, it is.
- I can see when Larry comes home...

150
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,664
Is he exhausted
when he comes home?

151
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,667
- I'm so sore.
- Not really. I'm not tired.

152
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,431
You gotta work on it
when you're not there.

153
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,563
You gotta do off-hours work,

154
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,335
so you're prepared
when you come into rehearsals.

155
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,104
It's not that I'm not
working as hard,

156
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,735
but it looks more
effortless maybe.

157
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,973
- It does look like less effort.
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:25,109
I mean, it looks...
less effort, effortless.

159
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,119
Yeah, like an idiot
holding the skewer.

160
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,213
- What the hell do I do with this thing?
- We're gonna mingle.

161
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,247
No, you should mingle.
It's your birthday.

162
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,623
It's your party.
Mingle if you want to.

163
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,390
If you see a skewer guy
will you send him over?

164
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,194
- Throw it down. It's fine.
- Yeah, relax. Larry, relax.

165
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,723
- Okay.
- Bye, guys.

166
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,030
Bye.

167
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,969
Did you tell Lar
about my new thing?

168
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:48,371
No, I actually didn't. Why don't you
tell Larry about your new thing?

169
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,037
- What are you doing?
- I'm designing these shirts now

170
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,673
- that are selling like hotcakes.
- Are you kidding?

171
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,878
- Interesting, whimsical. I'm telling...
- Good for her.

172
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,783
I got them in the trunk.
Wanna see them?

173
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,653
- Not right now, but I'll see them.
- You will, you will.

174
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,657
I wanna say hello
to Michael,

175
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,420
the piano player
from the show?

176
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,087
He can't
see my clothes?

177
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,161
- Hello.
- Larry?

178
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,361
Get out of here!
How did you know that?

179
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,267
- Aw, come on.
- I was doing a character!

180
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,867
Yeah, well,
I saw through it.

181
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,376
Listen, what are you
doing next week?

182
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,641
Tuesday night I'm doing a set
at The Mint. Can you come?

183
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,443
You'll enjoy it.
Show tunes.

184
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,541
Tuesday I think
I have a clan meeting.

185
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,849
- I don't know if I'm gonna make it.
- Thanks.

186
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:38,880
- Hey, where's Rhonda?
- She's parking the car.

187
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,985
- Hey, listen, let me ask you something.
- Sure.

188
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,326
Don't you think
she's beautiful?

189
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,854
Eh...

190
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,357
- Eh?
- Eh.

191
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,701
You don't think
she's beautiful, Larry?

192
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:56,538
I don't say beautiful.
She's nice.

193
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,476
Huh.

194
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,274
She told you
she was a model?

195
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,213
I don't wanna
talk about it.

196
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,376
What's the difference?
You can't see her anyway.

197
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,854
- What?
- That's one of the advantages, right?

198
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,948
- That and the good hearing.
- Good hearing?

199
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,720
What is that,
a myth?

200
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,784
I though blind people
had better hearing.

201
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,728
I don't know.
I've never had it tested.

202
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,061
- I thought you hear like a dog.
- Hey, Larry.

203
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,966
What's going on?

204
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,298
The thing that's
so great about these shirts

205
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,399
is that I've got
the business from the house

206
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,171
and I can take care
of the baby.

207
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,507
- Fantastic.
- I know.

208
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,308
Wait till you see them.
You are gonna die.

209
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,942
Okay.

210
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,443
Now, is this cute?

211
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:45,218
I mean, how much fun
is this, huh?

212
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,716
- Great, right?
- You know, nice.

213
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,889
- Yeah.
- Not quite my cup of tea,

214
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,297
but, you know,
it's nice.

215
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,960
All right,
you know what?

216
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,937
- Fuck you and fuck your tea.
- What?

217
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,461
Whoever said
you had taste,

218
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,440
Mr. Hushpuppy-
rumpled-suit look?

219
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,603
It's nice. You know,
we all can't like the same things.

220
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,546
When I showed them to Ben Stiller,
he happened to love them.

221
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,481
- Right, honey?
- He went nuts for them.

222
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,416
I have to be honest with you.

223
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,180
- Ben liked that?
- Yeah, he has taste.

224
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,246
All right, I'm sorry.
I think it's nice. It's just not...

225
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,315
Stop right now.

226
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,020
I'm gonna get
something out of the car.

227
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,926
I'll be right up.

228
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,488
- You know, they're...
- Agh!

229
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,076
That's the next
six months of our lives.

230
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,821
- Oh, man.
- Yeah, I know.

231
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,189
This is the woman
from the show, right?

232
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,989
She's coming
to Broadway with us?

233
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,895
Yeah, she plays Ulla here, and she's
going with the New York Company.

234
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,525
- What's her real name?
- Cady Huffman.

235
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:05,003
- You wanna meet her?
- I don't have to...

236
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,664
- Come on.
- You know her?

237
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:10,005
Yeah. Come on.
Yeah. She's nice.

238
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,907
- Hey, Cady.
- Hi, Ben.

239
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,434
How are you?

240
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,037
- I'm good.
- Happy birthday.

241
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,710
- Thank you. This is Larry David.
- Hey, Larry David.

242
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,117
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

243
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,677
- That's gonna be fun.
- Yeah.

244
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,383
- The three of us.
- Yeah.

245
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,517
- I'm gonna go pee.
- Oh, okay.

246
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,358
- You know where it is?
- I do.

247
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,058
- He's great, isn't he?
- Yeah, yeah.

248
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,999
It's not really...

249
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,060
it's not really his birthday
though, I have to say.

250
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,571
It was a couple
weeks ago.

251
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,630
You shouldn't be
having a birthday party

252
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,164
two weeks after
your birthday.

253
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,076
I mean, what's the statute
of limitations there?

254
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,104
Why don't I have my birthday?
My birthday was two months ago.

255
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,275
- I think I'll have a birthday party.
- Okay.

256
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,308
Okay, three days.
No more than that, though.

257
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,876
It's not your
birthday anymore.

258
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,480
There's gotta be a time,
a cut-off point

259
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,650
where you can't
have birthday parties.

260
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,455
Are you so desperate
for a party

261
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,962
that you have to have
a party two weeks after?

262
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,964
Wait till next year!
You missed it!

263
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,933
So, boo-hoo,
you missed the party.

264
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,303
What is this?
I've got...

265
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,569
I'm walking around
with this skewer all night now.

266
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,042
You can't get rid
of these things, you know?

267
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:21,638
I don't like a kebab. I don't know
what your feelings are about a kebab,

268
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,378
- but I'm not a kebab guy.
- Mm.

269
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,546
And then, you got this stick.
What do you do?

270
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,214
You put it
in your pocket?

271
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,554
Stick yourself
in the scrotum?

272
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,388
Then what
do you got?

273
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,327
Scrotum kebab.

274
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,563
- You know?
- Good to meet you, Larry.

275
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,089
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah.

276
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,710
- My dog has fleas?
- No!

277
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,083
"The garden has trees"
is what I said, Sammi.

278
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,146
- What are you playing? Telephone?
- Yeah yeah, telephone.

279
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,623
Maybe I'll join in.

280
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,421
Well, I don't see
any space, Larry.

281
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,519
You can
take my spot.

282
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,120
Oh, I wouldn't
take your seat.

283
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,596
No, go ahead
and play.

284
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:16,067
Oh my God. What a...
what a lovely, lovely child.

285
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,729
Very nice of you,
Alexandra. Okay.

286
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,102
Let's play
a little telephone.

287
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,334
You got one, honey?
Okay.

288
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,474
Okay.

289
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,957
I love tits?

290
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,825
- This is funny to you?
- He said it!

291
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,995
It's funny to say that
in a room full of children?

292
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,937
- What's the matter with you?
- That's what he said to me!

293
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,998
- Dalton, what did you say to him?
- I love pigs.

294
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,736
- I love pigs.
- No, you didn't say that.

295
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,244
- What did you say?
- I love pigs.

296
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,609
- I love pigs, Larry.
- No...

297
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,376
Your sick, perverse mind
twisted it around!

298
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,246
It's not funny!
These are kids in here!

299
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,311
He-he-he... well, what did...
no, you said...

300
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,289
No, he didn't.

301
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,917
Okay, he did
not say it.

302
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,928
We're gonna go sing
"Happy Birthday." Come on.

303
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,293
Tell them
what you said!

304
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,888
You know you
didn't say that.

305
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,832
- What did you say to me?!
- I love pigs.

306
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,030
- No, you didn't say that.
- So wrong, so wrong.

307
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,029
# Happy birthday to you #

308
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:33,306
# Happy birthday to you #

309
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:37,782
# Happy birthday,
dear Ben #

310
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,720
# Happy birthday to you. #

311
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,586
Yeah.

312
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,290
- Why didn't you sing?
- Huh?

313
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,558
- Why weren't you singing?
- I hate the song. I don't sing that.

314
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,861
Hey, Jeff. Come here, I wanna
show you something.

315
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,567
- I got this golf tip the other day.
- Really?

316
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,576
Yeah, it's like
for the backswing.

317
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,805
- Okay, show me.
- It's really working.

318
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,474
Um, all right, here's...
this is my golf club.

319
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,483
- Beautiful golf club.
- Watch this, okay.

320
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,712
Let's say that's
the ball, okay?

321
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:17,085
You wanna take the club
and give it back to the catcher.

322
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,749
- Right.
- Give it to the catcher.

323
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,383
- Here watch this.
- Ow!

324
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,725
Shit!

325
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,855
Jesus! Fuck!

326
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,162
Ow!

327
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,792
- I can't see.
- What did you do?

328
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,633
God! Honey...

329
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,436
Skewer.

330
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,951
You guys see how much easier
it is with the right shoes?

331
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,046
Okay, and here's
the other thing.

332
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,319
That's the rehearsal
tempo, all right?

333
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,553
That's the way I taught it to you
to break it down.

334
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,026
But it's more like this,
all right?

335
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,824
Got it?

336
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,464
And...

337
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,398
You're behind.
Keep it small. Keep it small.

338
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,772
- Keep your weight over the center of...
- That's too fast.

339
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,836
- I can't do it at that tempo.
- That's the tempo it is in the show!

340
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,144
Um, can we
take a five?

341
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,150
Five minutes, everyone.
Five minutes.

342
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,175
Use your time wisely.

343
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,557
That's bullshit. That's not
the tempo. Get out of here.

344
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,253
- I think it is.
- What?

345
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,228
- Pretty much.
- Pff.

346
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,163
Well, I don't know how any human
could dance to that tempo.

347
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,133
- You'd have to be Flash.
- Who?

348
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,068
Forget it.
It's a comic book character.

349
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,230
Wore the red costume.
The guy in the red costume.

350
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,173
- I don't even know what red is.
- Hmm.

351
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,870
It's hard to talk to a blind guy.
You have no references.

352
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,471
I don't know comics,
Larry.

353
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,243
What's with you?

354
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,409
Oh, Rhonda and I kept
fighting all night.

355
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,750
She keeps insisting that she's not
misrepresenting herself.

356
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,689
Oh, really? I'd like to tell my wife
I look like Brad Pitt,

357
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,022
but unfortunately
she can see. You dig?

358
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,153
- You know what I'm saying?
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,425
Hey, Ben, you're here.

360
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,988
Hey, Steve.
How you doing?

361
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,795
- Hey.
- Hey.

362
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,526
Oh my gosh.

363
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,597
I'm so sorry, man.
So sorry.

364
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,939
It's that skewer,
that fucking skewer.

365
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,672
- Remember I mentioned it?
- Mm-hmm.

366
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,771
- I couldn't get rid of it.
- I got a scratched retina.

367
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,577
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

368
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,584
I guess that's why you were
so preoccupied with that...

369
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,779
why you couldn't
sing "Happy Birthday."

370
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,221
Ben, I never sing
"Happy Birthday."

371
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,520
I feel uncomfortable,
self-conscious singing it.

372
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,424
# Happy birthday
to you... #

373
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,861
- You know, # Happy birth... #
- Stupid, stupid song.

374
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,922
- It's a stupid song.
- Right. And thanks for no gift, too.

375
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:45,266
I seem to recall somebody
inviting me to a birthday party...

376
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,533
and saying, "No gifts."

377
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,667
Come on, everybody knows
that's bullshit.

378
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,438
- Bullshit?
- Yeah.

379
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,379
- How's that bullshit?
- You say no gift, you bring a gift.

380
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,212
- Why'd you even say it?
- I'm just saying this as a friend.

381
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,718
You really have
a little ways to go

382
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,551
- when it comes to dealing with people.
- How so?

383
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,251
You don't even shake my hand
the first time I see you.

384
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,919
You had snot on your hand.
You'd just sneezed.

385
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,690
That was a dry sneeze,
Larry.

386
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,856
- It wasn't a sneeze.
- I can't assume dry!

387
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,763
- I gotta assume wet!
- It's air coming out.

388
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,495
I won't put out my hand
if it's full of snot!

389
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,163
I didn't know it was air.
I thought I saw speckles flying.

390
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,297
I would assume you would
know me enough to know

391
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,864
I won't give you
a handful of snot!

392
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,468
Sometimes you don't know
snot speckles are coming out!

393
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,978
I saw snot
speckles flying!

394
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,707
- Guys, we need to start.
- Yeah, please.

395
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,840
Top of the page,
page 31.

396
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,799
- Hi, Larry.
- Hey, Kim.

397
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,137
- How are you?
- Good.

398
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,802
Listen, I'm sorry
I didn't call,

399
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,971
but I was in the neighborhood
and I wanted to bring by my headshot

400
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,311
and my reel and stuff like that.
There you go.

401
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,838
- Come on in.
- Oh, thanks.

402
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,317
Wow, you have a really
beautiful house.

403
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,048
- Yeah, we just moved in.
- Did you?

404
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,957
- Ssecond time we've moved in two years.
- That's a nightmare.

405
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:17,484
Yeah, we had to move.
We had a film crew on our block and...

406
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,087
Oh, what a drag.

407
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,463
Listen, I've got a book
I want to give to Richard.

408
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,162
- So wait here, I'll go...
- Sure sure, whoa whoa.

409
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,900
Are you kidding me? You don't
notice anything different about me?

410
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,075
- # Da da da da da da. #
- Oh boy, oh boy.

411
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,977
- That's it?
- That's it.

412
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,947
- It's all done already?
- It's all done.

413
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:40,850
- Boy, that was fast.
- An hour. In and out. Done. Boobs.

414
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,786
Genius.
Don't they look real?

415
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,915
Remember you said they wouldn't
look real? Do they not look real?

416
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,222
You want to see them?
Check them out. Look.

417
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,955
They're good, right?

418
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,826
Feel them. They feel
totally natural.

419
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,559
- I'm sure.
- Don't be so uptight.

420
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,362
Feel 'em.
Check 'em out.

421
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,129
They feel good,
right?

422
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,694
Squeeze them.
Give them a little...

423
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,262
Come on.

424
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,246
She just... you know,
she grabbed my hands

425
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,514
- and she just put them over there!
- Oh, really?

426
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,544
Well, guess what?
Happy anniversary.

427
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,216
Because that was your
10th anniversary gift right there.

428
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,748
- Okay, oh, no no.
- Yes yes.

429
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,192
You can't do that.
That wasn't sex.

430
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:27,096
You just had sex!
Touching a breast is sex!

431
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,761
- It wasn't a real breast!
- Oh, really?

432
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,930
It was like putting my hand on her head.
It was nothing.

433
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,031
Then why didn't you put
your hand on her head?

434
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,770
'Cause she didn't put my hand
on her head. She put it over here.

435
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,971
I like that you can't
control your own hands.

436
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,004
She took my hands
and went like that.

437
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,710
I saw it. I saw it, Larry.
That's it.

438
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,050
- No, don't.
- Why am I even talking to you?

439
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,988
- Look, okay, let...
- Ugh! A titmouse!

440
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,951
- What?
- I just saw a titmouse.

441
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,398
- A titmouse?
- A mouse.

442
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,867
- Titmouse, mouse.
- Why do you call it a titmouse?

443
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,700
- That's what you call it. Same thing.
- Who calls it that?

444
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,138
A lot of people
call it that.

445
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,199
- Oh my God.
- What?

446
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,973
You are obsessed
with tits.

447
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,242
You're feeling up
somebody's tits!

448
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,943
- You're talking to kids about tits!
- Talking to kids?

449
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,646
The kid said, "I love tits."
That's what he said to me.

450
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,951
Why are you talking
to little boys about tits?

451
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,787
He whispered it to me!
It was part of the game!

452
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,793
Have you ever played
telephone before?

453
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,692
You don't know how
to play telephone, do you?

454
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,390
- I know how to play telephone.
- Do you?

455
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,399
Yeah, but I play
the G-version.

456
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,402
It's usually something like,
"Susie lives down the lane."

457
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,739
The kid didn't say,
"Susie lives down the lane."

458
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,437
He said,
"I love tits."

459
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,311
What?
Oh my God.

460
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,408
I'll be right over.
All right, sit tight.

461
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,350
What did you do?
I don't understand.

462
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,415
- Why did you break up with her?
- I need to be

463
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,051
with a good-
looking woman.

464
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:06,690
And since you were kind enough
to point that out to me, she had to go.

465
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:10,293
You need to be with a good-looking
woman? Who do you think you are?

466
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,963
Look, that doesn't matter.
I need some assistance.

467
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,973
She was indispensable.

468
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,202
Don't you have
any friends?

469
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,767
Yes, I have friends, but I'm not
gonna impose on them.

470
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,540
I think you
should help me.

471
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,514
You're the one who
got me into this mess.

472
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,551
I need a little help.

473
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,978
Thanks a lot, Larry.

474
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,650
Just grab it this way.
You don't have to get in between.

475
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,090
We're not a gay couple.

476
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,029
- Hey.
- Hey.

477
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,701
- What's doing?
- Nothing.

478
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,676
Um...

479
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:29,147
I actually wanna buy
one of those shirts.

480
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,082
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you know, the stud sweatshirts?

481
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,483
- Yeah, those are great.
- I need to buy one for Ben

482
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,282
'cause Susie said
he liked it, right?

483
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:39,688
- How's Ben doing?
- The eye is okay.

484
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,989
The eye is not
the problem.

485
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,860
The problem was
that I didn't sing "Happy Birthday."

486
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,865
- He's mad at you for that?
- I don't sing that song.

487
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,958
I never see you sing
the "Happy Birthday" song.

488
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,333
- It's a stupid song. I don't like it.
- You're entitled.

489
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,669
I was right about
those sticks, though.

490
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,936
I looked around
at that party at one point.

491
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:00,934
I saw five people holding sticks.
I did. I was checking.

492
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,948
- Can't just lay it down on a table?
- It's gross.

493
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,847
You can't put that
down on a table.

494
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,875
You have to wait for
a server to come by.

495
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,352
- Do me a favor.
- Yeah.

496
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,151
Get the shirt.

497
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,248
Do not say it's for Ben.
Say it's for you.

498
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,384
She's all pissed off
about the other night.

499
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,689
Fine, yeah, okay.

500
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,492
Susie!

501
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,557
What the fuck
do you want, Larry?

502
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,933
Well, you know what?
I would love

503
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,632
to buy one
of those shirts.

504
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,697
- Oh yeah, right.
- No, seriously.

505
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,266
It's like you go to a movie
and it kind of stays with you.

506
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,107
A good movie.
You know what I mean?

507
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,670
And so,
I don't know,

508
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,739
I feel I'm..."Why am I
thinking about the shirt?"

509
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,581
- I want the shirt.
- Really?

510
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,746
- Yes.
- They're great shirts.

511
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,517
I know they're
great shirts.

512
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,148
You know they're
great shirts.

513
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,886
Because the shirt
was talking to me,

514
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,451
and I need a little more flair.
I don't have any flair.

515
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,793
That is true.
I have them in the trunk.

516
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,230
- Really?
- Yeah.

517
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,393
We'll pick out a color.
Lar, it's like

518
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,630
- you're making me very happy now.
- Well.

519
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,605
Okay, I think the red
would look good on you

520
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,403
'cause you're kind of
pale and pasty,

521
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,637
and this is a great color,
the red. It's fun.

522
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,304
Why are you saying
pale and pasty?

523
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,779
Well, you are. You're not one
from the sunshine.

524
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,646
I play golf.
I'm out. I get sun.

525
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,277
All right, Larry,
I just think the red is a good color.

526
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,150
I have blue,
I have green...

527
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,622
- I'll take the red.
- The red is good for you.

528
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,420
- I look at them...
- Indiana.

529
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,428
You know, I had a friend
whose sister went there years ago.

530
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,589
- So there you go. It's perfect.
- Okay.

531
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,063
I don't think
I have a bag.

532
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,089
- Let me go in the house.
- I don't need a bag.

533
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,160
- I'll just take it.
- All right, fine. You made me happy.

534
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,537
- What is it, 60 bucks?
- It's 100 bucks. What are you, crazy?

535
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,633
No, you know, Lar?
Me to you.

536
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,509
- Get out of here.
- No, I will not take your money.

537
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,809
Your money's
no good here, darling.

538
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,783
- All is forgiven, honey.
- All right.

539
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:53,190
# Da dum da da
da da da da da. #

540
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,886
- Perfect.
- Great.

541
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,826
You get everything
the first time.

542
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,059
No no no, I've been drilling
that thing for two hours.

543
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,589
Well, see, you do your homework,
which is good.

544
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,898
Right there.
Turn around.

545
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,836
- Hey.
- Hey! Straight.

546
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,306
- I've got it.
- How are you doing?

547
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,707
Listen, I wanna
say something.

548
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:15,270
Happy birthday!

549
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:18,248
This is ridiculous.
You don't have to do that, Larry.

550
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,808
- I know, but I wanted to.
- I'm sorry.

551
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,582
Let me just say,
I'm sorry. Really, no no no.

552
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,886
I've been like
stressed out of my mind.

553
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,653
Listen, I stabbed you
in the eye, man.

554
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,660
No, I've been crazed
about this thing,

555
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,060
and getting into your space,
and I shouldn't.

556
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,758
You're doing
what you're doing.

557
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,733
We're gonna make it work,
and I'm sorry, okay?

558
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,169
- Well, I'm sorry too.
- Okay, well, let's be friends, okay?

559
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,571
All right? And you didn't
have to get me a gift.

560
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,507
I'm sorry.

561
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,511
- What is this?
- Open it up!

562
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,911
Oh, you got me
a gift.

563
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,755
- I knew you liked it.
- Oh, yeah.

564
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,586
Yeah, it's one
of those...

565
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,388
- it's a sweatshirt with studs on it.
- Yeah.

566
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:05,828
"Indiana."
These are the ones that Susie...

567
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,889
I know. She told me
how much you liked them.

568
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:11,494
- I love these.
- She said you flipped out over them.

569
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,937
So I thought, you know...
I thought it was like a perfect gift.

570
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,373
Like a fun sweatshirt.
Well...

571
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,810
- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you, thank you.

572
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,040
- All right.
- Okay.

573
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,242
- All right.
- All right. High five.

574
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:28,116
Oh yeah, sorry.
Still...

575
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,815
Okay, guys, Let's get started.
Top of scene three.

576
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,722
- All right.
- Better get a script.

577
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,953
Not off book
yet, huh?

578
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,189
Not on this scene.
Not on this scene.

579
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,197
Larry, you enter
from stage left.

580
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,256
Is that my left,

581
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,894
or "if I'm sitting
in the audience" my left?

582
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,769
- Which...
- It's your left right now.

583
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,774
Okay, so that way.

584
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,538
I always get those mixed up.
That's very hard.

585
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:56,604
Leo! Leo!

586
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,620
# Everything
has its season #

587
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:06,385
# Everything
has its time #

588
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:09,188
# Show me a reason #

589
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:13,095
# And I'll soon
show you a rhyme #

590
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,589
# Cats fit on
the windowsill #

591
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,594
# Children
fit in the snow #

592
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,870
# Why do I feel
I don't fit in #

593
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,469
# Anywhere I go? #

594
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:33,917
# Rivers belong
where they can ramble #

595
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,216
# Eagles belong #

596
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:40,520
# Where they can fly #

597
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,220
# I've got to be #

598
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:47,527
# Where my spirit
can run free #

599
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:52,195
# Gotta find my corner #

600
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,729
# Now's our inning #

601
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,834
# Stand the world
on its ear #

602
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:02,108
# Set it spinning #

603
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,877
# That'll be just
the beginning #

604
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:08,147
# Turn it up
like the lights #

605
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,553
- # We've got nothing to hit... #
- Okay, let's go.

606
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,216
Come on, right
after this song.

607
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:14,987
Oh my gosh,
I can't take anymore.

608
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,153
- Come on, it's "Gypsy."
- I'll be outside.

609
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,753
# Just you wait #

610
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:23,461
# That lucky star
I talk about is due... #

611
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,469
# Due #

612
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,767
# Honey, everything's #

613
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,570
- # Coming up roses #
- # Roses #

614
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:36,376
# For me and for you. #

615
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,281
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
