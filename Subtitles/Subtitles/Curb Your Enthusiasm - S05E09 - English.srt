Episode 5x09: The Korean Bookie

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,700
Larry!

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,000
God, Larry, come on, what are you doing?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,900
- We're late for the barbecue.
- Oh, okay.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,500
- Mark and Marla are going to...
- I'm all ready.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay, all right.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,600
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting a jacket.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,700
- Oh, you're not going to need a jacket.
- No, I am...

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,500
It's at the beach...

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,500
No, it gets very chilly at night at the beach, are you kidding?

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,502
There'll be a fire.

12
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,503
- Why are you wearing corduroys?
- I'll leave it in the car.

13
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:35,602
What's the big deal?

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,800
I think you're just a little overdressed.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,300
All you need are flip-flops and some jeans.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,400
You know the story of the three little pigs,

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,200
the one who built his house with bricks?

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,700
- Yes.
- That's me.

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,400
- Okay.
- I build my house with bricks.

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,700
I build my house with bricks.

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,800
- And by the way...
- I'm the third pig.

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
- When we get there...
- think of me that way,

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,500
the third pig.
- I will think of you as the third pig.

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,800
and when we get there,

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,600
will you please apologize to Mark

26
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,700
for the way you treated him at the seder?

27
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,000
- I told you...
- accusing him of stealing your newspapers?

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,100
I already apologized to him, I told you that.

29
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,600
I'm still not convinced he didn't take it.

30
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,000
What do you think about that?

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,800
... scared to go to bed

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,500
'cause the freaks at Dupont might get out of the cave.

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,600
I don't know how you can eat this thing, really.

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,500
- You want a bite?
- Huh?

35
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,700
Why don't you just burn everything you eat to a cinder?

36
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,200
Why stop at the marshmallow?

37
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,500
Aw, come on... they're toastin'.

38
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,100
- It's a light toasting.
- Doesn't matter.

39
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,400
It's the situation. We're sitting around a campfire together.

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,900
- That's why we're doing this.
- It's a fun...

41
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,400
I don't want to spoil your fun. You're having a good time.

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,100
I'm just saying it's idiotic what you're doing.

43
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,900
- Try this one. Try one.
- No, it doesn't taste good. I don't want it.

44
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,500
Thank you for your opinion, Larry.

45
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,100
That's a perfect fire I built.

46
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,800
Whose idea was it to have s'mores tonight?

47
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
He can't handle the truth.

48
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,100
- I'm cold. I'm gonna get my jacket.
- What?

49
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,800
- Love those s'mores.
- He should just try it.

50
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Another perfect one. Who's ready?

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,500
Who drank all the beer?

52
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,600
Somebody's been drinking all the beer.

53
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
My jacket's not in the car.

55
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,600
- What do you mean?
- Didn't I put the jacket in the car?

56
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,200
You said that you brought it with you.

57
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,900
- I brought it with me, in the back seat, right?
- Yes.

58
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,900
And I looked in the front seat and the trunk.

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,500
- That's really strange.
- Huh?

60
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,000
That's bizarre...

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,600
'Cause I know you brought it.

62
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,500
'Cause I made fun of you.

63
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,000
What, what are you looking at?

64
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,400
That's my jacket.

65
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,800
Marla's wearing my jacket.

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,900
She took my jacket from the car?

67
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,400
What is that?

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,300
I don't know, maybe she was walking by and saw it in the back seat.

69
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,300
But you don't go into someone's car and take their coat.

70
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,600
- She just grabbed it, she was cold.
- It's not her coat though.

71
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,100
Okay, well, it's not a big deal. Let's not make it a big deal.

72
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,100
Everyone?

73
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,800
- Uh, we have an announcement.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,400
We want you guys to clear your calendars

75
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,100
and hold the date of the 14th

76
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,200
and come back here where we're going to be getting married.

77
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh my god!

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,500
Congratulations.

79
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,600
Oh my god, that is so great.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
- Oh, thanks.
- Congratulations.

81
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,900
- It's going to be totally cool.
- Mazel tov.

82
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,600
- That's so exciting.
- Oh, thank you.

83
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Congratulations!

84
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,000
That's great... great news.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,500
I mean it just couldn't have been more perfect.

86
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Yeah, good, good.

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
- We're just happy.
- It's cold.

88
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,200
Where did you get that jacket?

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Oh, I got it from one of the cars.

90
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,900
Oh, okay.

91
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,200
Okay, no wonder...

92
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,200
- I was just so cold.
- Yeah, 'cause...

93
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,900
Yeah, 'cause that's... you got it from my car.

94
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,900
That's actually my jacket.

95
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was so cold.

96
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,400
Yeah, me too. That's why I went to the car to get the jacket.

97
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,200
'Cause I'm... I'm freezing and everything.

98
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,700
- Well, thank you.
- Eh.

99
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,500
'cause earlier in fact, before we came,

100
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,900
I was taking the coat and Cheryl was mocking me for wearing a coat,

101
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
'cause it's freezing, you know.

102
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
I'm not gonna take a coat... what, am I nuts?

103
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,700
I had the foresight to bring the coat.

104
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,700
You know what I mean? 'Cause I knew it's the beach,

105
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,600
it gets chilly on the beach.

106
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,700
- You know...
- Bring a jacket.

107
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,600
- Bring a jacket.
- Right.

108
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
You know, so I brought the jacket and...

109
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
and I was smart, you know, to bring the jacket.

110
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Larry, do you want the jacket back?

111
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,300
- Eh, oh... okay.
- Here you go.

112
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,600
- Are you sure?
- It-it did its job, truly.

113
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
- You sure?
- Yeah, you take it back.

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,700
All right, okay, okay.

115
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,900
Wow!

116
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,500
Wowie.

117
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,100
- Better?
- What the hell is this?

118
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,600
What is that?

119
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,700
- It might have been...
- What is that?

120
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,500
- I was eating a s'more...
- Is that a s'more?

121
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
It might have been. I was eating it, it's choc...

122
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,500
but it'll wash out, it's fleece.
- Oh my god. That's not gonna wash out.

123
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,100
- Look at that.
- Well, sure...

124
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,500
I'll take the jacket back with me. I can wash it.

125
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,000
It'll be fine.

126
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,700
- I'd be happy to buy you a new jacket.
- I see s'mores, I can't stand them.

127
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,900
I don't know how...

128
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,900
I-I don't know what people eat them for.

129
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,800
So somebody borrows your jacket, it's not a big deal.

130
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
You know what I mean?

131
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,700
You move on. You don't worry about.

132
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,200
You don't think about it.

133
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,700
How could I sit there freezing to death

134
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,600
while she's wearing my jacket?

135
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,100
It's not like there's something wrong with her and she's got an illness

136
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,600
where she really needs the jacket.
- You don't have an illness either...

137
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,900
She's a perfectly healthy woman wearing my jacket, I'm freezing.

138
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,400
Larry, they got engaged tonight, okay?

139
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,500
This was not about you.

140
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,800
It was not about your stupid jacket.

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,300
They got engaged.

142
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
Yeah, that's true.

143
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,200
Why would you even say that?

144
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,302
- 'Cause I was cold.
- Well, so was she.

145
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:36,903
Well then, she should have brought her own jacket.

146
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:40,202
I was the only one who anticipated that it was going to be cold.

147
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,700
And I should be rewarded for that foresight, not punished.

148
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,200
You know what? This is really... it's a serious thing for them to get engaged.

149
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,300
I did not ask her directly for the jacket.

150
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,300
If I say don't say anything,

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
do you know what that means?
- Yes yes, mom, yeah.

152
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,400
- Mom says...
- I feel like you don't know what it means.

153
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,100
If mom says, "don't say..." I didn't say anything.

154
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,400
You know how you said that you were the smart pig?

155
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,900
- Yeah, the smart pig... exactly, yeah.
- That made his house of...

156
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,800
but the thing about the smart pig that made his house of bricks,

157
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,500
he protected the other little pigs that came over.

158
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,400
Okay? He watched over them and helped them,

159
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,100
'cause he was a generous pig.

160
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,200
Yeah...

161
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,500
The pig also didn't come home

162
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,700
to find some other fucking pig

163
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,900
living in his house while he was locked out.

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,900
If the jacket were big enough for two people...

165
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,900
- I know.
- I would've shared it like the pig did.

166
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,200
Pig?

167
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,100
The pig... "the three little pigs," you don't know that story?

168
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,800
What pig? I don't know what pig is.

169
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,200
You know, "the three little pigs." One built...

170
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,500
the wolf was after the pigs. One built his house with bricks.

171
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,200
I'm the pig with the bricks.

172
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
When did it happen? In the news?

173
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,900
No, this is a fairy tale.

174
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,700
- Not real?
- Yeah, it's not real.

175
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,000
- Oh.
- Yeah.

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,700
All right, so what... what do I owe you?

177
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,600
I owe you money.

178
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
- 300.
- 300.

179
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,900
Can you believe I bet the Clippers? What kind of moron am I?

180
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,400
That is your fault, not mine.

181
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,300
I said don't, you did it.

182
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,300
- Have I ever won on the Clippers, huh?
- Never, never, mmm-mm.

183
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,400
A jerk.

184
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Okay, on tuesday...

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,800
- I think, uh...
- yes?

186
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,100
- I think I like the Knicks.
- You and I connect.

187
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,400
- Yeah?
- Huh?

188
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
They're getting three and a half points.

189
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,500
- 150.
- Okay.

190
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,800
Okay... I don't even have enough cash.

191
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
- Can I write you a check?
- Make it out to cash.

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
All right, come on in for a second. You can come in.

193
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,300
- That's something important...
- That's what I told him.

194
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,900
Hey-hey, look who's here.

195
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,200
- Boy, what are you feeding this animal?
- What you mean?

196
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,300
He's as fat as a house.

197
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,000
- My god, look at the size of him.
- What kind of thing is that to say?

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,700
You'll hurt his feelings.

199
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,800
- Like he knows what I'm talking about.
- He does, he knows!

200
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,100
You don't call a dog fat.

201
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,700
You go around calling Jeff a fat fuck.

202
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,900
Jeff is a fat fuck.

203
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,400
Oscar is just big boned.

204
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,300
He's not fat, he's lean. He's just right.

205
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,000
- Thank you.
- He's gorgeous.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,500
What do you feed the dog?

207
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,000
Food, you know, dog food.

208
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,600
Where do you live?

209
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,100
Uh, around the neighborhood, nearby.

210
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,600
Oh, they live about two blocks up, big gray house with white columns.

211
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,900
- Whi-white columns?
- Yeah, can't miss it.

212
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
It's right on the right side.

213
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,400
- Two blocks?
- Yeah.

214
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Um, I'll be right down.

215
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,400
This is Sung;

216
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,600
Cheryl, Susie, Oscar.

217
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

218
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,700
Nice to meet you.

219
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,100
He's a beautiful dog.

220
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,400
Why-why did you tell her the dog's fat?

221
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,200
Why? Because he is fat. He's gained about 25 lbs.

222
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,000
You don't tell her that. You can think that, tell me even.

223
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,400
- What the hell are you feeding it?
- She feeds it, I'm not.

224
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,900
I don't get the whole dog thing anyway.

225
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,700
- We had a dog... Sheriff, remember?
- Yeah, I know Sheriff.

226
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,300
It's like having a bum living in your house.

227
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,400
When everybody hates me, my dog loves me.

228
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,900
Stop the car for a second.

229
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,500
- That Heineman's car?
- Yeah, that's Heineman's car.

230
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
But look... he never fixed the dent.

231
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,800
Remember when I smashed into it?

232
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,800
He didn't fix it. I gave him a check for $1500.

233
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,200
He won't talk to me since his daughter jumped off the chair lift.

234
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,500
I'll be right back.

235
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,000
Oy, perfect.

236
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,800
- Hello.
- Larry.

237
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,500
I was driving by the restaurant

238
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,400
and I couldn't help but notice you haven't fixed the dent on the car.

239
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,100
No, I didn't fix the dent.

240
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,400
Hmm.

241
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,700
May I ask why?

242
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,500
Considering it's none of your business, I had better use for the money.

243
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
- Such as?
- If you must know,

244
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,700
I gave the money to my daughter

245
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,700
who needs it for something far more important than fixing a car.

246
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,400
- What does she need it for?
- It's really none of your business.

247
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,000
- It's a little unethical by the way...
- It has nothing to do...

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,200
- ...not to fix the car.
- It has nothing to do with ethics.

249
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,400
It's my money, you gave me my money.

250
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,200
I can do with that money what I please.

251
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,300
Are these pickles?

252
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,300
They're mine!

253
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,000
All right.

254
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,100
Man, take it easy.

255
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,600
- Good day, Mr. David.
- Good day, Mr. Heineman.

256
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Pfft, boy, that went well.

257
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,000
He said he has no intention of getting the car fixed.

258
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He gave the money to his daughter, he said she needed it.

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,500
Well, that's a big bowl of wrong.

260
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
- You can't do that.
- You can't do that.

261
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Hello?

262
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,900
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, ask her how the Knicks did.

263
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,200
- I got $150 on them...
- When?

264
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,400
You're kidding me?

265
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,500
Well, where are you?

266
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
All right, I'll be there in like 10 minutes.

267
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,300
Oscar went into the pantry,

268
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,300
had three boxes of oreos and now he's gonna die.

269
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,000
- What?!
- He's at the vet. He's gonna die.

270
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,900
I told you you're feeding that dog too much.

271
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
I don't feed him oreos!

272
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,500
All right, uh...

273
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,100
I'll be in the examining room.

274
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,600
Just wait out here. I'll be back.

275
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,200
Excuse me?

276
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,800
You wouldn't happen to know the score of the Knick game last night, would you?

277
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,700
Oh, the Knicks? Oh, that was a great game.

278
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,500
- Went into overtime.
- Really?

279
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, they lost by four.

280
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Larry?

281
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,500
- Oh, honey...
- No!

282
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,000
- Oscar's gonna be okay.
- He's sedated. He's gonna be fine.

283
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We're going to take him home.

284
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,800
- I love that dog.
- Oh, Larry...

285
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,800
- So sweet.
- Uh-huh.

286
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Oh, Larry.

287
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Hey, you got something from Marla,

288
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,500
to "Larry David".
- Marla?

289
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,800
The one who ruined my jacket? That Marla?

290
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,700
- Yeah.
- Really?

291
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,300
Well, give it to me.

292
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,300
- What are you opening it for?
- It's already open now.

293
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,400
She's my friend.

294
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,400
"Hi, Larry, sorry about the jacket, Marla."

295
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,700
There's a check.

296
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,900
What?!

297
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,900
A check!

298
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,900
$150!

299
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,200
Wow!

300
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,900
- Boy, you don't see that very often.
- What's that?

301
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,700
Well, somebody does something wrong and then they make up for it

302
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,200
with something like this.

303
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,100
This is quite a gesture.

304
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,300
I had her pegged all wrong, I think.

305
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,600
I guess I should keep it, right?

306
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Sometimes you rip up these checks, it screws up the books.

307
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,100
- Yeah.
- It does, honestly.

308
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,300
I'll keep the check.

309
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,300
It can really screw up the books, these things.

310
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,800
- Well, I-I...
- Really nice.

311
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm impressed that you even realize what a nice gesture that is.

312
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm apologizing all the time, telling people I'm sorry.

313
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,700
I know when I've done something wrong. I'm not afraid to apologize.

314
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,700
Most people, I have to say, and my mother always used to tell me this,

315
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,900
"most people aren't like you, Larry.

316
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,000
Most people are not like you.

317
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,200
You're special."

318
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,100
- You know?
- Yeah.

319
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,300
Everybody's not like me.

320
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,800
- No, they're not, no.
- When I do something wrong,

321
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,500
I say, "I'm sorry."

322
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,500
It's the big... you know, you give it up.

323
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,000
You do something wrong, you say it.

324
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's what she did.

325
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,300
That's what that check is about.

326
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,300
I know, I know and I-I...

327
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,600
Listen, this makes me feel so much better

328
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,700
to know how you feel about Marla now.

329
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,100
So when we go to their wedding, it's not gonna be weird.

330
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,100
- It will be comfortable. Yeah.
- It'll be comfortable.

331
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And I have to say, I thought it was very touching

332
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,400
how sensitive you were about Oscar today.

333
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh, come on... it's Oscar, man.

334
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
- Oh.
- I know, but I just...

335
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,900
I don't usually see you...

336
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,100
I don't know.

337
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,400
So... kind of in touch with your emotions.

338
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,300
- Really?
- And willing to...

339
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,500
I mean, you'd have to be inhuman not to feel something in a moment like that.

340
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,900
The poor dog is fighting for his life, you know,

341
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
I love that dog. I mean...

342
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,700
If anything ever happened to him, I-I don't know...

343
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,800
- I don't know what I'd do, but...
- Oh.

344
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,200
- I'm sure I'd figure something out.
- Larry.

345
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,500
I-I love that freaking dog.

346
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
- You know?
- I know.

347
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Huh. Hey, whoa, Nelson.

348
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,100
What you got up your sleeve here?

349
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,300
I don't know. What you got up your sleeve?

350
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,900
Am I detecting a little... daytime sex here?

351
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,700
Is that what this is about?

352
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,200
Daytime sex?

353
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,400
I love daytime sex.

354
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,500
Then you can just go on with the rest of the day

355
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
- as if nothing happen...
- Okay, okay.

356
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,000
Oscar!

357
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,100
Oscar, where the fuck are you?

358
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Jeff, look in the garden shed. He's got to be somewhere.

359
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,700
- Oscar!
- I'm looking.

360
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,800
Larry, have you see Oscar? Was he outside?

361
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,400
- No.
- He's missing.

362
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,000
- Oscar's missing?
- Yes, he's missing. He was sedated.

363
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,800
You know we sedated him yesterday at the vet.

364
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,700
He was lying in the backyard and now he's gone.

365
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,000
He could barely walk two steps... Jeff!

366
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,500
- I don't know. I've looked everywhere.
- Huh!

367
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,200
- I have no idea.
- Maybe somebody kidnapped him.

368
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,900
No one's going to kidnap a sedated dog.

369
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,200
Well, where the fuck is he, Jeff?

370
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
God. Oscar!

371
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,300
This is crazy.

372
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,500
- You know what?
- What?

373
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,300
- I have a korean bookie.
- Yeah?

374
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,300
- When he was over at the house the other day...
- Yeah?

375
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,200
He saw Oscar there. He was kind of drooling over him a little bit.

376
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
So... he likes my dog.

377
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,000
Well, you know it's not a myth,

378
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,900
they do eat dogs.

379
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,800
- They eat dogs?!
- Yeah.

380
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,300
Some Koreans eat dogs.

381
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
- Ugh!
- Well, you know what?

382
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,800
- What?
- I gotta go over there now.

383
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
He's got a flower shop. I gotta pay off my Knick loss.

384
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,700
I'll suss it out. I'll feel it out.

385
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,600
I'm sure he didn't eat your dog... I shouldn't have brought it up.

386
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,900
- Crazy!
- You shouldn't have brought it up.

387
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,300
- That made me a little...
- No, no, don't... forget it.

388
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,100
All right, forgotten.

389
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,900
He didn't kidnap and eat your dog, okay?

390
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,400
Don't... don't worry about it.

391
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,800
No, Marla. I got it taken care of. The beach is a good idea.

392
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Yeah, tell Mark I said hi.

393
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,700
Okay. Bye.

394
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,600
Who has a wedding on the beach?

395
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,500
Mark and Marla?

396
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,900
- Yes, you know them?
- I'm going to the wedding.

397
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,200
- You're gonna be there?
- Yeah!

398
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,100
- I see you there!
- What are you doing?

399
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,900
- Flower, dumb-dumb.
- You're doing the flowers?

400
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,600
- The wedding need flowers.
- Huh.

401
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,200
- Will you say hi to me or are you gonna dis me?
- No, I don't dis people.

402
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,800
- Okay, okay.
- I owe you money.

403
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,700
- Yes.
- Okay.

404
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,000
- Here we go...
- Uh, okay, unbelievable.

405
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,900
I'm... I don't have the cash.

406
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,300
- How come you never have cash, Larry?
- I'm sorry, Sung. I'm sorry.

407
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,600
- No, I see you on the...
- Never happen again, I promise.

408
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,500
- But listen, know what I got?
- What?

409
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I got a check from Marla

410
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
made out to me for $150.

411
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,500
I'll sign it right over to you.

412
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,000
- Okay, last time.
- Last time, Sung. I'm sorry, I promise.

413
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,400
- 'Cause I like you.
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

414
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,600
- Okay.
- I know where you live.

415
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
- Oh, you know what?
- What?

416
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,700
- You know who I'm liking?
- I have a feeling.

417
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,000
No, not liking, not liking, Sung, loving.

418
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
- Who? Huh?
- Loving.

419
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,000
Celtics!

420
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,600
I knew it, 'cause I think the same thing as you!

421
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,000
- How did you know that?
- You're going to win!

422
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I think it. You're gonna win.

423
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,200
- $300 on the Celtics.
- Winner.

424
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,400
- Let's pick 'em. I love 'em.
- Yes.

425
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,700
- I love 'em.
- How does it feel?

426
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,600
- I love the Celtics.
- It feels good, huh?

427
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
- Yeah.
- Yes.

428
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,400
What are you eating, Sung?

429
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Larry, this is fresh meat.

430
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,700
It's quite delectable.

431
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,800
What kind of meat?

432
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,300
The best kind.

433
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,100
Only the best for Sung.

434
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,100
So I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but...

435
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,000
Oscar's missing.

436
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,900
Oh, that's too bad.

437
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
He's a good dog.

438
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,200
- Yeah, he's a good dog.
- Yes.

439
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
You wouldn't happen to know anything about it?

440
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,200
Uh, no, Larry.

441
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,400
Are you sure?

442
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Yes.

443
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Okay.

444
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,200
See you at the wedding.

445
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,800
So, uh, I saw that car you hit the other day in the parking lot.

446
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
- Heineman's car?
- Yeah.

447
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,700
What the... Heineman's here?

448
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,000
I didn't see him, I just saw the car.

449
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,500
- What the hell is he doing here?
- No idea.

450
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
- What's with the hat?
- What?

451
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,700
- I'm married, I can wear whatever I want.
- It does look ridiculous.

452
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
You look like you should be pulling a rickshaw.

453
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,000
- I could care less.
- But nonetheless...

454
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,500
boy, I tell you something, this is one hell of a titty festival.

455
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,400
They're all over the place.

456
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,600
Big bosoms everywhere you look.

457
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,800
- You know what it is?
- What?

458
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,400
Mark obviously invited a lot of his clients.

459
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,600
Of course, of course!

460
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,600
He gave them all boobs jobs, invited his clients.

461
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,100
Oh, hey, there's Sung, my bookie.

462
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,700
- Oh, what happened with Oscar?
- Nothing. Forget that.

463
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,800
Is that Heineman's daughter? Yeah.

464
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,700
No wonder why the car's there.

465
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,800
- Look...
- Jesus, look at the size of her.

466
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
- What has she done?
- Holy shit.

467
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,300
Heineman told me that he took the money I gave him, the $1500

468
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,000
and gave it to his daughter and didn't tell me why.

469
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He said she needed it for something.

470
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,900
I paid for those things.

471
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,400
You paid for those giant fake titties.

472
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,500
Come on, man. What is that? What's up with that?

473
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,300
Okay, we'll talk to you soon. All right, bye-bye.

474
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
- Wow!
- Hello.

475
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Hello.

476
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,400
How are you?

477
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,900
I'm fine, thank you.

478
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,700
You've undergone quite a transformation since the last time I saw you.

479
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,500
Yes, my father thought it would bring more joy toy social interactions.

480
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
- Really? Is that what he thought?
- Yes.

481
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,300
Let me just say this, okay?

482
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
"Less is more."

483
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,000
I think you went a little... too big on it.

484
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,300
It's just my opinion.

485
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,100
Well, thank you for your opinion.

486
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,000
But we thought they would be festive if they were appropriately sized.

487
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,700
They-they're festive, man. That's a festival if I ever saw one.

488
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,200
I don't know what kind of guy you're going after with those things,

489
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,400
but you're not gonna get somebody like me, I can tell you that.

490
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,800
Oh well, oh god.

491
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,600
All right, whatever.

492
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,300
- Good luck with them.
- Thank you.

493
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,800
- I hope it works out.
- It's been working out.

494
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,700
- Really?
- Yes, it has, absolutely.

495
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
- Hey.
- Hey, Larry.

496
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,600
- Is this your handiwork?
- It sure is, yeah.

497
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,800
- One of my best patients.
- Really?

498
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,100
- How are you?
- Good, thank you. They feel great.

499
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,400
My lumbar section of the back hurts a little.

500
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,800
You went a little big on it, didn't you?

501
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,000
Were you drunk at the time you did this thing?

502
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
He thinks they're too big.

503
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,700
This is completely natural, Larry.

504
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,700
- It's proportionate...
- It's natural at a freak show maybe.

505
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,900
- I don't think so, I think they're perfect.
- Not very subtle.

506
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,300
It's not about subtlety, Larry, it's about excellence and confidence.

507
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,000
- I paid for them, by the way.
- Excuse me?

508
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah, I gave your father a check for the car, $1500.

509
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
He gave it to you for this.

510
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,800
- Not all of it.
- My check, my check paid for those.

511
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,700
- That's where my money's going.
- Maybe covered the left,

512
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,800
the bottom portion of the left half.

513
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,300
Exactly. Exactly.

514
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,800
Excuse me.

515
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,600
You wouldn't happen to know the score of the Celtic game last night, would you?

516
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Uh... Celtics lost by three.

517
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,000
Man...

518
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,800
Why can't I catch a break on this shit, oh!

519
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

520
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Larry?

521
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,300
Larry, what's wrong?

522
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,300
I just told him the Celtics lost.

523
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,500
Oh, I think I'll... get my coat.

524
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
I'm getting a little chilly.

525
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,100
Mark, do you take this woman, Marla,

526
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,300
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

527
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,300
to have and to hold until death do you part?

528
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I do.

529
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
And do you, Marla, take this man, Mark,

530
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,100
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

531
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,100
to have and to hold in sickness and in health

532
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,100
until death do you part?

533
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
You have got to be kidding me.

534
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,500
- Honey... What?
- Is there a problem?

535
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Where's the new jacket, Larry?

536
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,600
There... I didn't buy a new jacket.

537
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,500
I sent you $150. Did you receive it?

538
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
- Yeah.
- Well, where is the new jacket?

539
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,000
Well, I didn't buy a new jacket.

540
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,500
It's my money. I can do whatever I want with it, no?

541
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,500
No, that was my money I gave to you to replace the soiled jacket.

542
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,200
I told him to buy a jacket...

543
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,200
- First, you destroyed my jacket.
- ...before he sees you again.

544
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,200
I don't need to buy a new jacket just 'cause you say.

545
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,100
Did you read the memo of the check I sent you, Larry?

546
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,700
It said, "replace fleece jacket."

547
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,700
Replace fleece jacket.

548
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,500
- Unbelievable.
- Ever tasted anything like this in your life?

549
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,000
It's fantastic.

550
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,300
- This is unbelievable.
- I've never tasted anything like it.

551
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,600
- What is this dish?
- What, you're talking about this?

552
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,700
- Yeah.
- It's pulgoki. The korean florist brought it.

553
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,000
It's delicious.

554
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Oh, boy!

555
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,500
Oscar!

556
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Hey, pulgoki's Oscar! You're eating a do-oooog!

557
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You're eating a dog!

558
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,700
Water!

559
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,000
Drink of water!

560
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,300
Holy shit, it's Oscar!

561
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Larry! Larry!

562
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,400
- You all right?
- Yeah.
