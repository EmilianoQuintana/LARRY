00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,409
A beautiful Sunday,
we're sitting here like idiots.

1
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,478
We should be
playing golf.

2
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,353
Yeah. How do you
work a glue gun?

3
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,382
Oh, yeah, like I know
how to work a glue gun.

4
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,394
Should we try going
to a public course?

5
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,055
On a Sunday
it'd be a long wait.

6
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,031
When do you think I'm gonna
hear from the new club?

7
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,261
- Thursday.
- My interview went very well.

8
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:36,768
I thought mine
went great too.

9
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,464
- It did?
- Yeah!

10
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,837
- Did you have the tall blond guy?
- Two guys.

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,934
- I think they took a shine to me.
- Took a shine to you?

12
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,569
- I really do.
- Okay.

13
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,477
I don't know what
to do without golf.

14
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,709
When I'm done
with this paper,

15
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:53,207
- I'm gonna wander the streets.
- Wow.

16
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,845
You wanna get
the violin out?

17
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,413
- Get the violin out.
- That's pretty sad, yeah.

18
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,517
Another thing, I'd love to get to this
Dodger game tomorrow night.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,289
- I called everybody I know.
- You did?

20
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,659
- Yep. Nothing.
- Nothing?

21
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,256
Everybody at Dodger Stadium,
from top to bottom,

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,994
nobody's got tickets.

23
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,626
It's gonna
be some game.

24
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,762
I know.
I wanna go too.

25
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,797
It's too bad we got kicked out
of that golf club.

26
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:19,039
Marty Funkhouser has two
season tickets to the Dodgers.

27
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,547
His father just died.
He's probably not even going.

28
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,572
He hasn't even gone
back to work yet.

29
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,413
So he's not gonna
go to the game.

30
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,444
So what's gonna happen
to those tickets? They'll go to waste.

31
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,719
It is weird to ask a guy,
you know his father just died,

32
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,386
- can we use your tickets?
- It is kind of tacky to do that.

33
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,793
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,957
Huh.

35
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,898
Still,
I mean...

36
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,334
it doesn't hurt to ask.
It might be a way to...

37
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,031
What do you do, just call him up
and say, "Hey?"

38
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,870
"Marty, I know you're
still in mourning..."

39
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,103
Right. I'm sure you're
still in...

40
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,011
"Marty, I know you're still in mourning,
but is there any..."

41
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,481
"I feel your grief, but are you
gonna use those tickets?"

42
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,916
"Marty, just so your tickets
don't go to waste."

43
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,682
There's no good way
to go about it, none.

44
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,980
Still...

45
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:08,221
You know every Sunday
he has brunch over at Nat's.

46
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,228
Well, we gotta get
some breakfast anyway, right?

47
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,461
We just say hello,
we happen to run into him.

48
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,595
Let's get breakfast.
Maybe we'll run into him,

49
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,400
say hello. We'll feel it out,
check him out.

50
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,066
Zip in, zip out,
say hello.

51
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,099
If the subject of baseball
comes up, it comes up, that's all.

52
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,373
Ah, see him?
See him?

53
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,783
Yeah.

54
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,189
Yeah, it's tougher than
I thought, but hopefully

55
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,658
- in a few weeks, I'll feel better.
- Look at this!

56
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,183
- Hey, hey.
- Look-a here.

57
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,695
Look what's
going on here.

58
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,960
Do me a favor, call me back
and we'll play maybe.

59
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,466
Bye.

60
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,400
- Hey!
- How you doing, Lar?

61
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,232
Good to see
you guys.

62
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,001
- I can't believe you come in here.
- I eat here all the time.

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,837
- I used to eat here with my dad.
- Oh...

64
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,105
- Yeah.
- I've never seen you guys here before.

65
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,374
We were talking about it,
I thought I'd try it out.

66
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,880
- We were hungry.
- Yeah.

67
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,712
- It's great food.
- Yeah, what's good?

68
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,217
I always order
the turkey.

69
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,775
Little turkey
action today.

70
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,014
- Little turkey action today?
- Turkey today.

71
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,522
I just can't
eat today.

72
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,457
I've lost five lbs.
in two days.

73
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,221
I have no appetite.

74
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,955
By the way,
you know,

75
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,860
I'd just like
to apologize again

76
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,991
- about the whole 5-wood incident and...
- It's forgotten.

77
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,764
- I hit the shit out of that club.
- I know you do.

78
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,896
You know that.
You've seen me hit that club.

79
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,407
- Let's not talk about the 5-wood.
- All right.

80
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,500
- You guys get into Beverly Park?
- Not yet.

81
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,477
We interviewed.
We're waiting to hear.

82
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,275
- Waiting to hear.
- Good luck.

83
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:38,182
- Great course, have you played it?
- Uh no, I'm a Jew.

84
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,314
Ah, funny. Oh, hey, who do you like
in the Dodger game tomorrow night?

85
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,380
It's gonna be tough,
it should be a great game.

86
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,016
- Yeah.
- It's sold out.

87
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,027
It's a shame about
your dad and all

88
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,961
because, well,
you're probably...

89
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,430
just not up for going
to the game, I guess, huh?

90
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,092
No, I decided
I'm gonna go.

91
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,794
- No kidding?
- Good for you.

92
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,996
He would have
wanted me to go.

93
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,698
- I think that's true.
- Mm-hmm.

94
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,866
- Don't you?
- He would have, most certainly.

95
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,376
Hey, if you're
a little lonely,

96
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,878
you need a little
companionship at the game,

97
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,780
if you want me to keep you company,
I'd be happy to do it.

98
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,807
I don't have
a seat for you.

99
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,979
- What about your dad's seat?
- It's spoken for.

100
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,683
- Okay, all right.
- Okay, well, you have a good time.

101
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,352
- Great seeing you guys.
- Turkey, gonna get the turkey.

102
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,327
- You're gonna love it.
- Good, thank you.

103
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,820
- Where are those seats anyway?
- Uh, they're third base, field level.

104
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,833
Hmm.

105
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,334
Okay.

106
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,836
Hey, you know what?

107
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,770
If you hear
of anything...

108
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,363
Where am I gonna
hear of anything?

109
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,069
Sometimes you hear
that so-and-so's got an extra ticket.

110
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,840
- The game's tomorrow.
- Okay, well,

111
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,746
if the person who you're taking
might drop out, you know...

112
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,943
No dropping out.

113
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,217
The tip, remember
the weatherman's tip?

114
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,784
The statute of limitations
has gotta be up on that, no?

115
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,422
You're still asking
about the golf tip?

116
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,796
Forget it.

117
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,399
Daddy-o!
Hey hey.

118
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,773
You, wearing that
old "Seinfeld" jacket?

119
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,438
- Oh, this?
- Yeah, you're still wearing that thing?

120
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,344
I'm trying to get out
of jury duty today.

121
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,373
I'd do it, but I'm in the middle
of rehearsals for "The Producers."

122
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,682
That can help you
get out of jury duty?

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,052
They hate people
in the entertainment industry.

124
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,557
They don't want them serving,
so I thought what the hell?

125
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,616
And they'll look at
the "Seinfeld" jacket

126
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,093
- and throw you out?
- Yeah.

127
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,755
All right.

128
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,822
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, darling.

129
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,493
Hello, look who's here,
my beautiful wife.

130
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,162
I know that girl
from someplace.

131
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,194
She looks
very familiar.

132
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,705
I'm glad
I caught you.

133
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,207
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

134
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,903
- I gotta go downtown.
- Oh, for jury duty.

135
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,504
It's hard to get out of these things.
I don't know what,

136
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,572
I'm gonna have
to make something up.

137
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,277
I would serve if they
made me the foreman, but...

138
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,047
Yeah, I don't think
you get to choose.

139
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,147
I can't serve under another foreman.
That's not gonna work.

140
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,885
No, and then what
are you doing?

141
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:03,157
I'm gonna go... I guess I'll go
to Jeff's house and watch the game.

142
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:07,155
Would you rather
go to the game?

143
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,192
I got you tickets.

144
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,535
What, are you
kidding me?

145
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,938
Where did you
get these from?

146
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,169
You know what, I'm not
gonna reveal my sources.

147
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,077
But just trust me, they're good.
I got you two tickets.

148
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,910
That's pretty high up
in the alphabet.

149
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,247
- Okay, then, you know what...
- I'm just joking around.

150
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,616
- You wanna go with me?
- No no.

151
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,178
Go with Jeff. I know you guys
were working on tickets.

152
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,350
- That is so nice.
- Oh oh.

153
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,190
- Thank you, that's so nice of you.
- Well, you guys have fun.

154
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,752
Okay.

155
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,991
- You got a wonderful girl there.
- Yeah.

156
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,261
What are you doing,
"TV Guide" crossword puzzle?

157
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,996
Yeah. Tell you the truth,

158
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,472
I'm having so much trouble with the
glaucoma, the pressure on the eyes...

159
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,237
All right, look,
I've told you 10 times already.

160
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,506
- Let me get you some marijuana.
- No, come on.

161
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,844
- Try the marijuana.
- Again, marijuana. Will you stop?

162
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:59,181
Do I look like some kind of beatnik?
I'm not gonna... with the marijuana.

163
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,051
What beatnik? It's good for glaucoma...
make you feel better.

164
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,283
Medication is...
it's not working.

165
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,883
You take a couple of puffs,
you'll feel better, so what?

166
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,156
Is that bad? Why should you be
in pain like that?

167
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,595
All right, will you stop
nudging me about that, I...

168
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,826
Just do it.
If I get it, will you do it?

169
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,993
- Where you gonna get this?
- I have no idea.

170
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,094
You gonna go out on
the street and pick up...

171
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:21,402
I don't know how I'm gonna get it,
but I'm gonna get it for you, okay?

172
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,738
If you'll
do it with me.

173
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,767
I'm not gonna have any,
but you will.

174
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,110
- All right.
- I'll see you later.

175
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,637
All right, right.

176
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,014
Ms. Whitaker, have you ever
served on a jury before?

177
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,819
No.

178
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,985
Have you ever been
the victim of a crime?

179
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,120
No.

180
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,027
Is there any reason
you can think of

181
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,532
that you would not
be able to decide this case

182
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:51,503
- in a fair and impartial manner?
- No.

183
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,903
- Okay, thank you for your time.
- Absolutely.

184
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,931
Moving on,
Your Honor.

185
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,977
Could you state
your name, sir?

186
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,572
- Larry David.
- Mr. David, I'm Counselor Condon.

187
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,742
Counselor Condon,
nice to meet you.

188
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,184
Uh, have you ever served
on a jury before?

189
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,619
No.

190
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,487
Have you ever been the victim
of a serious crime?

191
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:15,460
My cousin once stole
an Almond Joy from me.

192
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,659
It was upsetting
at the time, but, um...

193
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,634
I don't think that would be
considered a serious crime.

194
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,364
Is there any reason you can think of
that you would not

195
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:28,134
be able to decide this case
in a fair and impartial manner?

196
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,666
I don't know if I could
be impartial, Mr. Condon,

197
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,441
given that the defendant
is a Negro.

198
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,747
Problem?

199
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,307
Good afternoon,
good afternoon.

200
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:10,782
Uh, I couldn't help
but notice the, uh...

201
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,252
the transaction
between you and the...

202
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,915
the other gentleman,
and uh...

203
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,857
What exactly were
you thinking of?

204
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:24,829
A little, uh, a little weed going,
you know. Some weed?

205
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,332
Yeah, I got it.
I got it, yeah, you know.

206
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,664
- First of all, calm down a little.
- Sure.

207
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,169
Just, you know,
relax, just...

208
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,670
Yeah, no,
I'm... I'm...

209
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,163
Create the illusion that we're friends talking
here, all right?

210
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,675
You kidding me?

211
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,302
You know what?
You're 100% right.

212
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,245
That's too much,
all right, that, yeah.

213
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,373
Okay, you're doing fine.
Just chill out.

214
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,579
I can get you an ounce of,
like, some real, you know,

215
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:50,111
hydroponic scientific stuff,
but that'll run you $500 bucks.

216
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,954
- Hydroponic?
- Yeah.

217
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,187
I'm not looking
for a sound system, my friend.

218
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,161
- Hydroponic.
- You know what I mean?

219
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,757
Just looking to get
my father a little... a little relief.

220
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,394
Let's play it safe.
I'll give you an ounce of schwag.

221
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,894
- Schwag?
- It'll cost you $200 bucks.

222
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,373
- An ounce of schwag, $200.
- $200.

223
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,809
Is that a fair price
you're quoting me there, sir?

224
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,245
Look, you can pay me
$200 bucks or go fuck yourself.

225
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,249
Okay, well...

226
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,878
Look, I don't need to sell the drugs,
the drugs'll sell themselves.

227
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,220
- Sure.
- You know, forget it.

228
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,952
- No, let's do schwag. Schwag.
- Just keep walking.

229
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,154
No, no, Schwag, $200,
okay, I got it.

230
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,254
I got it. So what do we do,
what happens now?

231
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,821
- You got $200 on you?
- Yes, yes.

232
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,662
All right, take out
the $200 bucks.

233
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,396
- I'll count to three, where is it?
- It's right here.

234
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,405
- Let me... let me put my hand on it.
- Just give me your money, sir.

235
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,101
One... hold it. You're not
letting me put my hand...

236
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,769
Your hand
is on it.

237
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,801
- All right.
- One, two, three.

238
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,615
- All right, now keep walking.
- Okay.

239
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,744
- Any particular direction?
- Just just just please move.

240
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:54,878
Which...?

241
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,753
Just walk, just walk,
just walk.

242
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,280
Jesus Christ.

243
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,196
I gotta
go this way.

244
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,164
Just go, just go.

245
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,732
What? Oh, Jeff, you're not
going to the game?

246
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,039
What are you kidding?
Oh my God.

247
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,544
No, it took me
so long in court,

248
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,274
now I can't even
ask Cheryl to go.

249
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,781
Aw, you should see
the traffic.

250
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,681
The only thing moving
is the carpool lane.

251
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,686
I'll never make it.
I'm just gonna go home.

252
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,518
I'm not gonna use
the carpool lane by myself.

253
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,649
'Cause l...
I don't want to.

254
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,356
That's the difference
between you and me.

255
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,556
All right, goodbye.

256
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,531
Hey, Daddy.

257
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,659
You wanna date
with Mama?

258
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,378
Get in the car.

259
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,248
- So, what's your name?
- Monena.

260
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,279
What you...
what you into today?

261
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,291
A little
lollipop love?

262
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,054
A little digging
for diamonds?

263
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:12,258
See, actually, I'm not really
interested in any sex, per se.

264
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,199
Per... you one of them
freaky motherfuckers or something?

265
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,601
To tell you the truth, what I'd like
to do is I wanna go to Dodger Stadium

266
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,368
and, uh, I wanna go to the game
and I'll pay you for your time.

267
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,137
What?
Five hours it'll be.

268
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,700
You just want me
to sit in the car?

269
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,804
Just sit in the car,
that's all you have to do.

270
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,907
Oh, you a crazy son of a bitch.
All right, $1,000.

271
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,510
$1,000. What,
are you kidding me?

272
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,520
- That's, uh...
- $200 an hour?

273
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,523
Exactly, I can give
four blowjobs an hour.

274
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,457
- Four blowjobs an hour?
- Yes, I'm good.

275
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,826
I drove a cab, used to drive around
for two hours. I couldn't get a fare.

276
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,763
You're getting four
blowjobs in an hour?

277
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,891
Yes, honey, you done
picked up the best.

278
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,333
Honey, I got a red snapper
that talks to you.

279
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,859
You know what
it's saying?

280
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,895
I'm charging
way too much.

281
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,930
$750 and take me
to the game.

282
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,772
I'm going
to the game then.

283
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,573
I can't take you
to the game, Monena.

284
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,547
I'm terribly sorry,
I only have one ticket.

285
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,776
$750... you know
this is not fair!

286
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,012
Listen, you're unhappy.
I'm unhappy too.

287
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,282
That's what a good compromise
is all about.

288
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,016
Are you familiar
with Henry Clay?

289
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,524
No, I don't know no Henry Clay.
What'd he say?

290
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,959
He was the Great Compromiser.
This is a good compromise.

291
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,088
- It is not a good compromise...
- A good compromise

292
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,927
is when both
parties are dissatisfied

293
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,126
and I think that's
what we have here.

294
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,171
Boy, look at this.

295
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,572
We are really
zipping along here.

296
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,008
I'm gonna
make this game.

297
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,878
- This is great.
- I thought you only had one ticket.

298
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,712
That's two tickets.

299
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,843
I'm meeting a friend
there actually.

300
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:43,116
No, I'm gonna go to the game or you're
gonna take me back to the corner

301
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,056
or I'm gonna call my
motherfucking pimp. How 'bout that?

302
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:50,027
Yeah!
Yeah, I didn't think so.

303
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,030
Let's go
to the game.

304
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:55,431
Ow, baseball! I ain't never been
to no baseball game. This gonna be cute.

305
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,027
All right, well, pull... pull your
thing up over there.

306
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,537
Make yourself
presentable.

307
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,200
You know you're gonna
have to feed me.

308
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,732
I want two hot dogs, a bag
of peanuts and a milkshake.

309
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,905
- They got milkshakes?
- I don't know if they have milkshakes.

310
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:11,474
Hey, don't put your wallet away 'cause
you know I'm gonna get hungry again.

311
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,611
- And that's...
- Stop talking for a second, would you?

312
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,678
I know the seats
ain't way the fuck up here.

313
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,246
You got a problem
with the seats?

314
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,520
You said we had good seats,
club seats and shit.

315
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,754
We're way the fuck up.
Shit.

316
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,763
There are a lot worse things
you could be doing.

317
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,494
- Whatever.
- Let's just watch the game.

318
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,926
Charge!

319
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,166
What you looking at?

320
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,438
My friend Marty Funkhouser
sitting next to an empty seat.

321
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,843
He said he was taking
somebody to the game.

322
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,417
Oh, I know you
ain't looking around

323
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,215
like you scared somebody gonna
recognize you or some shit.

324
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,451
- Trying to act like you ain't with me?
- No, what are you saying?

325
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,720
- I will pull a titty out in this thing.
- Don't...

326
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,159
- I will pull a titty out...
- Don't you dare do that.

327
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,720
- Act like you with me then.
- I'm with you, I'm with you.

328
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,823
- I'm acting like I'm with you.
- Okay, cool.

329
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:04,097
- That's better like that. I will...
- No, don't.

330
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,195
That's better.
Okay.

331
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,206
All right, yeah.

332
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,231
All right,
yeah.

333
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,645
- Shit!
- Who are they?

334
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,444
Two guys who interviewed me
for this golf club.

335
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,212
You know what?
I gotta get out of here.

336
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,617
- I'll be back.
- I'm not playing with you.

337
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,214
- You better come back.
- I'll come back, don't worry.

338
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,623
If I'm not back, I'll meet you
at the car after the game.

339
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,628
What the fuck
are you looking at?

340
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:35,294
Batting for the Atlanta Braves,
the catcher, Javy Lopez.

341
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,269
Ball one, all right, three more
of those and we force one in.

342
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,137
- Hey, Marty.
- Hey, Larry, I see you got a ticket.

343
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,902
Yeah, the seats
really stink though.

344
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,378
- I-I'm sitting all the way up there.
- What can l...

345
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,471
Oh, there's a hit.

346
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,379
Oh, foul ball.

347
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,384
Hey, what
a great game, huh?

348
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,285
- Is anybody sitting there?
- No.

349
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,186
- Can I join you?
- No.

350
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,851
Why not?

351
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,852
Well, uh, it's a seat
for my father.

352
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,566
Your father's dead.

353
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,629
It's a memorial.
We used to go to games together.

354
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,401
It makes me feel
close to him.

355
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,136
It's to honor him.

356
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,576
Oh, no!

357
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,738
Home run, yeah!

358
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,613
- Come on, Marty, let me sit there.
- I can't let you sit there.

359
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,777
- What, are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

360
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,344
- You're not gonna let me sit there?
- Not even for a minute!

361
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,855
Are you nuts?

362
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,880
Right fielder...

363
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,359
- Thanks, Marty.
- Gary Sheffield.

364
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:39,160
Thanks.

365
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,332
- Oh, you back fast.
- I told you I'd come back.

366
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,672
You did, you did.
There you go.

367
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,734
Now I bought us
some popcorn.

368
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,712
You're a sport.

369
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,238
We gotta go out
more often, really.

370
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,772
I gotta
pay you back.

371
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,614
Yeah, you don't
give a shit.

372
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,348
No, I...

373
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,225
If you're ever looking for a good
blowjob at a reasonable rate...

374
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,965
she's your gal.

375
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,834
That was good.

376
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,803
You got some big...
oh, you a pimp.

377
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,305
Larry, Larry, come here
a minute please.

378
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,910
One second.

379
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,751
You're not gonna believe this,
but my car won't start.

380
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,456
Oh my God.
What a shame.

381
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,192
It is. Listen, I've gotta pick up
someone at the airport.

382
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,722
And I know
it's on the way.

383
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,361
Can you give me
a lift, please?

384
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,964
Why don't you ask your father
to help you jump start the car?

385
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,840
Hey, Leo, why don't
you give him a push?

386
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,845
I'm sorry about the ballgame.
It was emotion.

387
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:04,474
Just give me a ride.
Let's not go through this, please.

388
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,144
There's one
little problem.

389
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,313
I'm with
a prostitute.

390
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,790
My eyes are closed.
I'll sit in the back, do what you want.

391
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,851
I didn't pick her up for sex. I picked her up
so I could use the diamond lane,

392
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,919
so I can get to the stadium
on time for the game.

393
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,160
I buy it. Just give me a lift
to the airport, please.

394
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,361
All right,
I'll tell you what,

395
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,098
- I'll take you.
- Oh, that's so great.

396
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,629
But I want
the weatherman's golf tip.

397
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,571
That's the only thing
I can't do.

398
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,636
- Eh, your friend will take a cab.
- Okay, wait. Done deal.

399
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,910
- Let's go.
- Okay...

400
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,577
- take your normal stance.
- All right.

401
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,213
Forget everything you've
ever thought about golf.

402
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,291
Thanks a million for the ride.
I gotta go.

403
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,093
- I'm coming in with you.
- Nice meeting you, Winona.

404
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,600
- I'm gonna use the bathroom.
- How long you gonna be?

405
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,535
- I'll be two minutes.
- What if the security people come

406
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,629
- and tell me to move the car?
- Drive around.

407
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,469
Keep driving around
and around.

408
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,635
You in overtime,
this is some bullshit.

409
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,307
Hey, do me a favor,

410
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,817
Just hold on to my jacket
when I use the bathroom.

411
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,785
Why don't you
bring it in there?

412
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,447
Where am I
gonna put it?

413
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,978
What if they
don't have hooks?

414
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,097
It's not my marijuana!

415
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,936
I was just
holding the jacket!

416
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,942
What are you doing?

417
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,342
This isn't
even my jacket!

418
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,176
It doesn't
even fit me!

419
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,977
Get your hands
off of me!

420
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,483
Easy!

421
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,007
Get that dog
away from me!

422
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,358
What took you
so damn long?

423
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,293
Marty got arrested
for marijuana.

424
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,728
- You're bullshitting.
- I'm not bullshitting.

425
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,961
I asked him to hold my jacket
and there was marijuana in the pocket.

426
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,695
You had marijuana
in your pocket?

427
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,703
I bought it for my father
for his glaucoma.

428
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:09,264
I bought it this afternoon
and I forgot, I completely forgot!

429
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,175
You don't need no damn marijuana.
I got the best shit in town.

430
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,769
You should have
said some shit.

431
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,871
- Chronic.
- Put that down. Are you crazy?

432
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,711
There's cops all over
the place here.

433
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,376
That's some good shit
right there.

434
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,181
- Chronic.
- This is schwag.

435
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,654
- What the fuck is schwag?
- Schwag.

436
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:27,056
- You don't even know what you bought.
- I bought fucking schwag, okay?

437
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,185
You don't even know
what the fuck schwag is.

438
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,957
Have you ever
bought it before?

439
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,590
- Huh?
- Schwag? Yeah.

440
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,534
This is chronic, okay? It's gonna clear
your daddy's eyeball problem and shit.

441
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,130
We gonna hook Daddy up. Put that on my
motherfucking bill... that ain't free.

442
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,232
Okay?

443
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:47,575
- Okay?
- Got a little... little problem.

444
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,945
"Little problem..."

445
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,884
I don't quite have enough
cash to pay you tonight.

446
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,887
But I'm, you know,
I'm totally good.

447
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,287
I'll pay you tomorrow.
I'll come to your house...

448
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,951
Tomorrow? This ain't
motherfucking pussy on layaway!

449
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,757
You better take your little
trying-to-trick-a-bitch ass

450
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,990
in there to the motherfucking
A.T.M. machine.

451
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,932
I can't 'cause I went to
the A.T.M. machine this morning.

452
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,060
I already took out $500.
There's a limit.

453
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,536
I am not fucking
around with you.

454
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,368
You know how much
money you owe me?

455
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,569
- I thought we were "cool de la."
- That's "cool de la" shit?

456
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,238
- I thought we're cool de la.
- You trying to be hip all and shit.

457
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,180
I'll tell you what
I'll do with you, okay?

458
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,581
- What you gonna do?
- Okay, here's what I'll do.

459
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,710
We'll go to my father's house,
get some cash,

460
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,687
settle, everything
clean, okay?

461
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,588
- I'm not going to your daddy's house.
- What's the big deal?

462
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,457
You're dragging me around all day
and ain't paid me nothing.

463
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,325
I took you to
a baseball game tonight.

464
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,490
None of that good shit. We sat up
in them fucked up seats way up there.

465
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,660
- Fucked up seats?
- You bought me one little hot dog.

466
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,829
Yeah yeah, which you
proceeded to blow.

467
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,505
Hey.

468
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,914
- So late at night, for heaven's sake.
- What, I was at the game.

469
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,417
I was just about
to go to bed.

470
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,012
- Did you watch the game?
- Nah, watch the game.

471
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,046
It's just so blurry
I can't watch.

472
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,752
Um...

473
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,522
I got the stuff.

474
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,153
- Listen...
- This is it.

475
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,663
- That, uh...
- Huh?

476
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,689
- That's the stuff?
- I got it, okay?

477
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:15,825
Yeah.

478
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,836
- This is a joint.
- It's a reefer.

479
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,168
Yeah, absolutely.
You light it up.

480
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,071
You go like this.
Put it in your mouth...

481
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:26,305
- You gotta inhale.
- Hold it in your lungs.

482
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,040
Hold it inside.

483
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,570
And then...

484
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,244
- See how long I did that for?
- That's a long time.

485
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,881
- Not a cigarette where you're like...
- Oh, okay, so, um...

486
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:41,484
- I'm getting dizzy just from that.
- Yeah yeah, so...

487
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,222
- So you do that a couple of times...
- Yes yes.

488
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,389
and then turn the TV on
and see what it looks like.

489
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,023
I'll leave
this here.

490
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,626
- Do you have any cash?
- Yes, I got cash on me.

491
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,136
- What do you need?
- Hundreds.

492
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,865
No, I don't have
that kind of cash.

493
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:56,339
- How much do you have?
- I got around $35-40.

494
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,242
Wait wait wait,
let me put this away.

495
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:02,940
Wait, oh my God,
don't-don't... don't answer.

496
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,979
- Hello.
- What are you doing?

497
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,484
- I'm coming in.
- No no...

498
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,316
I told you about
putting me in...

499
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,618
- You always got me waiting in the car.
- I got it.

500
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,216
- I don't want you coming in here.
- I'm coming in there.

501
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,557
You tripping!
What's wrong with you?

502
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,722
Oh look at your cute
little daddy, yeah.

503
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,927
- Uh, this is a friend of mine.
- Okay, hi!

504
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,367
This is Monena.
She's uh... a friend.

505
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,963
- That's your friend?
- We went to the game together.

506
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,438
She's a friend
of Cheryl's.

507
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,373
Cheryl couldn't make it
so I took Monena.

508
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,537
- So you went with another girl?
- No, it's Cheryl's friend.

509
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,138
Look, sweetie, we brought you
a little eye medicine.

510
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,172
This your dad?
We gonna hook you right up.

511
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,116
Little Daddy got
the little eye problem.

512
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,414
Look what
we got for you.

513
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,943
Oh, that's a joint.

514
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:46,014
Yeah, this is a joint.
Very good, Daddy.

515
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,649
Chronic.

516
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,058
- I have a joint.
- That's very good, honey.

517
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,722
You want to go sit down
and smoke it?

518
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,028
She's a lot of fun.
You two, you two go sit and smoke.

519
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,034
No no no, I want you
to do it too, you know?

520
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,899
You have
to do it too.

521
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,635
- Yeah!
- Uh, okay.

522
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,575
- Okay.
- All right, it's okay. Come on, Daddy.

523
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,478
That's right, this is Bubonic Chronic.
This is real good for you.

524
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,913
Oh, good good!

525
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,358
No, no more,
no more.

526
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,363
I want to tell you
what this is.

527
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,661
- What is it?
- That's good shit.

528
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:31,100
You're crazy!
"That's some good shit!"

529
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,570
I wonder what it is
to smoke bad shit.

530
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,307
- We're gonna do some Ebonics.
- Ebonics?

531
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:42,211
Just say this.
"Dis chronic is the shiznik."

532
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,148
Dis chronic
is the shizmik.

533
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,151
- The shizmik!
- Shizmik.

534
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,552
- For shizzle my nizzle.
- For shizzle my...

535
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,355
that sounds almost
Yiddish to me.

536
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,859
Yiddish Ebonics.

537
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,988
Yeah yeah, you
holding on too long.

538
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,931
Look at that.
He blew the scene.

539
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:23,020
Gei kucken ahfen yam.

540
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:26,387
Gei kucken ahfen yam.

541
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,154
How about
"He's a meshuggener"?

542
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,422
- Me...
- "Meshuggener."

543
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,487
"Meshuggener?"
What's that, Ebonics too?

544
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,726
What are you
looking at?

545
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,996
You see something?
Huh?

546
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,866
What did I do?

547
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,270
You know what you did.
You did nothing!

548
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,774
If you want me to do
something just tell me.

549
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,038
You gotta change the diet.
I told you about that.

550
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:49,069
I don't want the red meat. You're eating
the red meat. I don't like that.

551
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,638
I'm doing
the best I can.

552
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,549
Go to a doctor. Get yourself
a checkup. Colonoscopy.

553
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,577
Are you afraid to get a colonoscopy?
What's the matter with you?

554
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,818
- I'm sorry.
- Everybody gets it. Get a colonoscopy!

555
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,655
l-l... I'm really
gonna do it.

556
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,456
You know
something?

557
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,554
You're a good
human being.

558
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,394
Oh, thank you, Nat.

559
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:10,833
And you know,
I love him too.

560
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,564
He is my boy.

561
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,004
Fucking faggot!

562
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,476
You got your father-in-law's birthday
coming up. You gonna get a card?

563
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,307
- Okay.
- You're not gonna get a card.

564
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,336
You're not gonna
do a fuckin' thing!

565
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,041
I'll try
and do better, I will.

566
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,277
TV TV TV, that's
all you like to do!

567
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,845
- Read a fucking book!
- You're right, you know everything.

568
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,857
Who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

569
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:40,763
- What happened to her?
- Making a phone call.

570
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,166
- She's a very nice girl.
- Oh, yeah.

571
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,534
You know something?

572
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,699
This stuff?
I can see.

573
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,369
- I swear to you, I'm not lying to you.
- Really?

574
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,640
You're coming through
so crystal clear.

575
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,476
You're kidding me.
Really?

576
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,540
It's a miracle.
I swear to you it's a miracle.

577
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:03,042
- That's fantastic.
- All right, you ready to go?

578
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:08,023
Oh my God.
It's a hooker!

579
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,699
All you have to do, Larry, is get up
there and tell the truth.

580
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,397
- Okay.
- That's it, okay.

581
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:22,497
- It wasn't your jacket.
- Just keep me out of this completely.

582
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,599
It was Larry's jacket,
it was Larry's grass.

583
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,305
- He's on trial, I'm not.
- Right, it was your pot

584
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,506
for your father's
glaucoma.

585
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,708
You know, you could be
a little more grateful.

586
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,083
- I did come and get you off the hook.
- Thanks a million.

587
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,714
Why didn't you tell me there was
grass in the jacket?

588
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,122
- I didn't know there was grass in it.
- You didn't?

589
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,785
- You bought it.
- I forgot.

590
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,453
Guys, I just need you
to be earnest.

591
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,861
The judge has to find you
a credible witness.

592
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,455
Where is my jacket,
by the way?

593
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,866
- I don't know.
- You were the last to wear it.

594
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:54,338
Who gives a shit about your jacket?
I'm sure you can get another one.

595
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,272
You know I know
the way out.

596
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,775
Holy shit.

597
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,937
Oh, Mr. Baseball,

598
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,413
Mr. Owe-Monena-$200.

599
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,008
You said five hours
and it was seven, honey.

600
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,884
You still owe me $200.
I want my 200 skrilla.

601
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,014
- Okay.
- This is your anniversary present?

602
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,754
No no, see, I was
going to the ballgame...

603
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,762
I want my money, baby.
I need my skrilla.

604
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,457
- You got any cash?
- Maybe 20.

605
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,931
- You got any cash?
- I got nothing.

606
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,937
All rise for the Honorable
Judge George Nagel.

607
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,406
Is that the judge?

608
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,881
- Yeah, that's him.
- Oh no.

609
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,283
Well, Mr. David,

610
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,621
what do you have
to say for yourself?

611
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:51,425
Well, you see, Your Honor,
my father has this condition.
